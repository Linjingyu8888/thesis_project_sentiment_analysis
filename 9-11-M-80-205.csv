We got a number and were told it could be 35mins. That was absolutely fine and it was Saturday lunchtime during LFW.We wandered off and came back to a drink and our table. The wine was spot on so that set a good first impression.It is noisy and crammed, but that's part of the experience I guess. For the restaurant chain it will ensure a quick turn around of diners.For London, the food is 'proper' food-fresh and tasty. The tagine was served with cold quinoa which didn't really work. We didn't have dessert as the portions are big and we shared chips.Service throughout was cheerful and speedy. Water was complimentary which is a rare find in the city."

If you have a more refined palate or prefer less crush and more privacy, then don't go here. My first visit was a mid week lunch. Altogether a different more relaxing experience."

However the incredibly noisy dining room made conversation virtually impossible for me and my companion - as a result I would not go back nor recommend it to others. Not being able to book a table in advance is also a huge negative for any restaurant even with the excellent cocktails on offer at Mildred's. The overall rating is a blend of Excellent for the Food and Poor for the noise and inconvenience of the no bookings policy

On the other hand, my friend and myself spent 10 minutes or so chatting at the tiny bar instead, not bad at all. When we got a table in the fairly small room crammed full of tables and chairs, both of us reflected on the fact that it was quite noisy due to the place being packed with people talking. On the other hand, the menu was full of tempting dishes. There were many vegan dishes on the menu and if you are gluten intolerant, there are many things you can eat at Mildred's.The food was really good and the portions were big enough for me not to crave dessert, even though I was tempted. The service was quick and friendly. If you can stand being close to people while eating and can endure the volume of a roomful of people talking, you are in for a treat!"

The serving staff were friendly and the menu had a good variety. The burger was excellent as were the sweet potato fries and avocado mousse. Salads were also tasty. The food arrived promptly and the atmosphere was buzzy. We were there at 2pm and it was still pretty packed. I suspect queues are frequent at popular times. Worth a visit definitely."

We expected it would be busy as they don't take bookings, but upon arrival it seemed rather disorganised. Nobody came to us on arrival, and there were others standing around. My husband asked the bar man basically what do we do, the bar man rudely addressed us, saying no its too busy, it will be atleast an hour, there is noting having more people in here cause there is no room?? My husband asked for a number which others who were waiting had. The bar man had no interest in advising us what was protocol. Soon a manager came over and took our name and gave us a number, we were told it would be about half hr. We ordered a drink and patiently waited. Unfortunately the bar man ruined our experience as well as our friends, which is a shame because actually the food was very good and reasonably priced. Not sure I will be in a rush to go back though."

Be expected to wait for an available table..But please trust me when I tell you it IS worth the wait! We ordered the lemon ricotta pasta which was light, perfectly seasoned and utterly divine...the sauce had me nearly licking the plate clean but social decorum and the fact that you are seated very close to other tables stopped me.. It was mouth wateringly good! We had side dishes of yellow courgette in some delicious sauce that came warm, a wonderful coconut and papaya salad that was light and again seasoned to perfection, vegie gyoza which were smaller than expected but came with a rich soy dipping sauce and definitely filled the spot. The blue corn chips with home made gauc which you can't really get wrong - but Mildred's certainly made it soooo right!Another stand out of the meal was the tofu and lentil burger w/ vegan cheese (£8) which we had with a side order of fries (£4) with basil mayo...and although the mayo was not vegan it was a taste sensation anyway. I couldn't get enough of the burger and I was so sad when I had finished it I nearly ordered another one!! But we needed to save room for the raw chocolate tarte (£7) dessert of course..That slice of heaven was served with fresh sliced strawberries and was rich, dense and decadent. And vegan! So although we did have a mix of both vegan and vegetarian dishes I was more than impressed with it all, I'm sure there are a few other faves on the menu that are vegan..In fact I did see the table beside hme had the burrito which was a generous serving and definitely something I want to try next time. And there WILL be a next time. Price wise it didn't break our bank, and it is Soho after all so you must expect central London prices, but it was affordable. For two people with four alcoholic cocktails we paid £75 in total and we left very satisfied (and a little bit tipsy..). Service was lovely, our waitress was attentive and kept on top of our needs even though it was a busy Saturday night. So all in all I recommend you try out Mildred's for a fancier vegan/vegetarian meal that even meat eaters will appreciate. Just be prepared to wait a bit (order a cocktail! And don't be afraid to request a cocktail that's not on their menu - we did and it was made for us without a problem!). Enjoy the area of Soho afterwards without feeling weighed down by a heavy meal. Looking forward to coming back in to Mildred's for a meal very soon! x"

This has now happened a few times. On my last visit, food was OK as usual (still, nothing you will ever talk to your grandchildren about), but the reason why after a few years I will now stop dining at Mildreds is the fear to bump again into the obnoxious waitress who, with her condescending behaviour, managed to ruin my day, rather than offering a window of relax."

There are no reservations possible at Mildred's so it's turn up and wait for a table. The place was extremely busy at 7pm on a Friday evening and we were advised the wait was around an hour. I must say that the staff were extremely efficient at handling the waiting customers and kept track of every party - there was no worries that we had been forgotten. We had cocktails whilst we waited and we were soon offered a shared table in a room upstairs which was just perfect. The vegetarian menu was varied and interesting and all the food we had was delicious and cooked perfectly. Our young waiter was incredibly polite and helpful and when my coffee arrived about 5 minutes after I had finished dessert he apologised and said it was ""obviously"" on the house and my dessert would be removed from the bill! Very impressive considering I wasn't bothered in the slightest. I would definitely return to Mildred's or try the Kings X or Camden branches in the future."

The cocktail I had was horrible and I drank only a third - it had orgeat in it which wasn't listed (should be it contains nuts) - I asked the waiter to take it away as I finished and told him I didn't like it but nothing was said. The food was ok to very good we shared dishes - the hummus was the best I've ever had but the service was very disappointing - the waiter didn't know what was in any dish (we asked what the sauce was for the pasta in front of us) and he couldn't tell us (it was cream) he insisted on bringing a massive book of allergens out for us to check ourselves - they were extremely busy but I get the impression that's normal so you'd expect them to be ready. Took a long time to get attention if you need anything. The food wasn't good enough for us to return and not cheap! Dinner for two and a bottle of wine? £75!

The first was on my plate which I tried to ignore because I had basically already finished my meal but then I found the second hair and it ruined it. I'm a blonde and so is my boyfriend... so it couldn't have been one of ours. We waited over an hour for a table, which we expected given the popularity of the place. While waiting we enjoyed one of the cocktails on the menu. The cocktail was a spin off of a Pina colada with passion fruit, presentation was beautiful and the drink itself a 7/10. While we expected to wait for an hour, what we didn't expect was to sit at the table a further 10-15 minutes before a waitress got close enough that I could flag her down to put through an order. I felt that we might wait another hour if I didn't grab her attention myself. I expect to at least be greeted by the server and provided with water when I sit down, especially after waiting for an hour. After putting our order through the food and drinks came out quickly. We just ordered a glass of the house white wine... Absolutely DO NOT DO IT. It was far too acidic and literally was the worst glass of wine I've ever had, post meal I felt sick from the level of acidity in the wine. The burrito tasted great, it was quite hardy but then I found the hairs and it has turned me off this place completely. I question their sanitary practices... How does a hair make its way into my food? It was literally wrapped into the inside of my burrito meaning it was one of the kitchen staff's hairs. They should be wearing hair nets and requiring kitchen staff to have no facial hair to prevent things like this from happening. On a final note, the place was way too loud."

I had heard about Mildreds so much on Vegan sites and was desperate to try it out, however there was a little apprehension as I had read both glowing and negative reviews commenting on service from the staff and the wait to get in. I felt that I could deal with both if the food and general ambience was good and warned my family that there may be a wait, but that the food would be worth it from what I have read! (never saw a bad review on the food)! So we arrived early evening and yes it was busy, with the queue already forming out of the door, I braced myself as we neared the supposed rude staff to be pleasantly surprised that we had a warm welcome, even though it was super manic! We were given a number and advised to wait around in the bar area. So we did! It was busy but a great atmosphere and while we waited we had drinks while I marvelled at all the cocktails being served! I had Prosecco and my husband had a virgin mule, which was ginger beer, elderflower, lime, vanilla syrup, which looked amazing! The lady who greeted us was very attentive and even checked in with us a few times to let us know where we were in the queue, and that a couple in front of us had offered up their table as we had kids with us - (Lovely)! Anyway, when we did go to eat we were led up to a room upstairs, it was a bit like a front room of a house and was fantastic as there appeared to be a lot more space than the seating downstairs. I can see that it would be a little cramped in the downstairs seating but I am sticking to my own experience and we had plenty of room, with a waiter who literally looked after our room alone so we were never left waiting for service (nor did we feel rushed, even though we knew there were hoards waiting below). The Guy was great, and the food was served incredibly quickly! Now, for the food!! The main event ofcourse, I had been dreaming since lunch time of the 'fennel and sunblushed tomato sausages with wholegrain mustard, garlic and spring onion mash with kale and onion cider jus', it was exactly what I had been craving and did not disappoint! It was sumptuous! My husband ordered the 'sri lankan sweet potato curry with roasted lime cashews, pea basmati rice and coconut tomato sambal' which also looked amazing and he actually admitted that if we were at home he would have licked the plate! We also ordered a few sides including 'smashed avocado with lime, chilli and blue corn chips' which even my incredibly fussy son ate! All in all the food was as I had hoped for. I often feel when I go out (and I am trying to put this in a very non arrogant way) that I could maybe do better, or the food is not creatively made, and leave feeling disappointed, however my husband commented 'Isn't it nice to go away feeling that you could not have done better at home' which is a great compliment I guess! When you are Vegan you do get creative and most Vegans end up becoming the cooks they never thought they were, and when you eat out, you want to be spoiled, not dished up a boring unflavoursome meal. On to the pudding, my son had the Vegan ice cream which I had a bit of (not a fan of ice cream in any form) and it was really creamy and he ate the lot, and my husband and myself shared the 'jamaican banana and date pudding with rum raisins, rum butter sauce and coconut whipped cream', which tantalised the old tastebuds and left us feeling very happy customers. So, whilst I can see that it is a wait to get in and a little busy downstairs, if you want good Vegan food with ambience, candlelit tables and somewhere that serves Mocktails and Cocktails, then definitely give Mildreds a go!"

On to the deserts and again all were good, but I think the chocolate and peanut brownie was probably the star. The other point to note is that one of our party is allergic to dairy and wheat intolerant and the menu was also very good for them. Will definitely be going again, with or without vegetarians.

Two tables (for two) outside so we sat at one (good choice since the music inside was VERY loud). Extremely pleasant and efficient service. Despite some of the main courses sounding delicious, we opted for a selection of smaller starter dishes to share. The gyoza dumplings were scrumptious, the potato and pea samosas were excellent, and the smoky babaganoush as good as any I've tasted in Jordan and Syria. Flatbread was fine but we were a little underwhelmed by the rose harissa hoummus. I think the ""standard"" hoummus should not be tampered with (i.e. mashed chickpeas, blended with tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic). All in all, very tasty food indeed, and somewhere I will be very happy to return to. The Virgin Mule ""moktail"" (ginger beer, elderflower, lime and vanilla syrup) was a bit sweet, but if you ""mash"" the fresh mint leaves that decorates it into it, it becomes a much more pleasant drink."

The service wasn't warm in the American idiom but the staff were very pleasant and efficient. They do a good French 75 cocktail. The appetizers and main courses were all delicious - I had the Sri Lankan sweet potato curry, which had an excellent balance of flavors and was very satisfying. The desserts were less successful - I'd suggest only considering whether a vegan version of an old favourite is really going to work; I think we could have chosen better overall. My fruit crumble was okay in principle but was so overheated as to be almost unapproachable. Overall, it's absolutely worth having a meal here as a visitor to London - it's very easy to get caught up in more traditional, ah, stodgy British food, and Mildred's provides a very satisfying array of alternatives."

The sweet potatoes seemed a bit 'stale' but we kept this anyway! After mains I asked what the crumble of the day was. The staff member said Apple and apricot with custard. When this came out I was soooooooooo disappointed! It looked stale and had mint leaves all the way through it which tasted gross you could barley tasted Apple never mind apricot! And oh to top that off the custard was cold!!! But not to worry they quickly offered to microwave it for me!! Had to order the chocolate brownie instead to make me feel happy!! It was delicious!

The place was very busy and we had to wait for 10-15 minutes before we got a table. The staff were courteous and helpful. The menu has items influenced by cuisines from all over the world, but the predominant theme is mediterranean with some Mexican and Srilankan food. Most of the items are vegan with some gluten free options as well. There are some items with cheese. The waitress insisted that all the cheese they serve are vegetarian, but I doubt as the menu has one main course that has parmesan cheese. We ordered halloumi cheese and hummus for starter. It was delicious, but not the best we have had. Our main course were a Mexican inspired black bean burrito and a Japanese fried vegetable stew. Both were above average, but we have had better tasting mexican and japanese food in other places for a cheaper price. Our side order, sweet potato fries was average, but the chipotle sauce it was served with was really good. The starter and the main were so filling that we had no space for a dessert.

I'll start with the positive:*Being a meat eater, I have always looked forward to dinner at Mildred's as the food has been amazing and perfectly presented - albeit when dishes are available. Now for the negatives:*The wait.... I came with my friend and we only needed 2 seats..Despite being told we had a 30-45 min wait, the two diners who were in the queue after us (couples) were seated and served before us. Very disappointing seeing as a lady runs about with an I-pad implying she seats people in order. We had to chase her to ensure she hadn't forgotten us and - miraculously we were 'next' on her list.*You have to wave your hands frantically to be served by the server *I've been here 4 times for dinner and on 3 occasions before 7:30pm they had already run out of the Pumpkin, ricotta and sage tortelloni with wild mushroom, marsala cream sauce. If a dish is so popular - why not ensure you have enough ordered for a dinner service? or make sure you inform people its no longer available before presenting the menu?*The server could not explain what 'sauce' was in the 'pasta of the day' - he just said its an aubergine and pepper pasta with big pieces of vegetables in 'a sauce' - but could not define 'what' the sauce consisted of*Icing on the cake - my burrito resembled something which had been thrown on a plate with guacamole splattered on it and then microwaved to near death to the point the beans had exploded around the edges. It must've then been left on the side as it arrived cold. Although my friends burger came out looking amazing and was nice and hot! She has the Tofu burger - which I would highly recommend. All-in-all we wouldn't go back as the place is just too over rated with a huge lack of respect and no regard for customer service. The food wasn't bad hence they've managed to redeem a star from me but this is not a restaurant to relax in or expect a smile. We left feeling more upset than angry over the whole experience and could not wait to get the hell out of that place. Honestly can't quite understand all the brilliant reviews on here - unless they are based solely on the food. We will certainly not be returning."

The food we ordered was very tasty as were the smoothies. There is a good selection and very reasonably priced. Being new to vegetarian food I was struggling with what to cook and serve at home which we could all eat as a family and a trip to Mildred's prompted me to buy their cook book which also has a fantastic selection of recipes - including vegan, Gluton free plus some incredible deserts."

The food was good and the cocktail very nice too but the staff definitely need to communicate much better with one another. I arrived alone and my friend was on her way (about 10mims away). The gentleman seating everyone said there was a table for 2 ready and I could sit down or wait at the front for my friend so I waited. Lots of people then came in so I asked the lady near the front if I could take up his offer of sitting down to wait. She rudely said 'no sorry we don't seat you until your both here, put your name on the list.' I did this but then saw about 3 separate women come in, all waiting for their friends too, but they were seated alone straight away, by the gentleman. It was like one rule for one person and another for someone else. Your sat in a cramped restaurant, some people were even seated on the same table as other diners! They rush you through your dinner, whipping your plate away as soon as you take the last mouthful and if you don't fancy dessert, the bill is pretty much presented straight away. I got the impression they wanted to get us out. There's MUCH better service in other restaurants in London for the same price I'm afraid and to me, the service is just as important as the food. Not sure I'll be going back too quickly."

On getting there, it was extremely busy and you could barely get through the door which was a bit daunting at first, however, don't be perturbed by the queue as it is really worth the wait and you can try a range of cocktails whilst you wait! We tried the Pornstar Martini, Maid in Mexico and Turkish Rose all of which were amazing in taste and presentation! When we were seen, we were told it would be an hour wait, this sounds like forever but once your having cocktails and chatting it goes by really quickly!!I've been a Vegetarian since I was 6 so am always so excited when trying out a new Veggie restaurant and absolutely LOVED the buzzy, happy and excited atmosphere that Mildreds has to offer. It has a really lovely mix of people! Once we were seated, we were presented with the menu that has such a large variety of different vegan and vegetarian dishes. I was delighted to hear that they even have vegan mayo and vegan cheese which was a novelty!! One of my friends went for the curry, another went for the Polish Burger with Sweet Potato Fries and I went for the Classic Tofu Burger with Chips. All were out of this world and I would definitely recommend the Vegan Basil Mayo to go with it! It was so so filling I could have literally just had the burger! We then had the Brownie which was quite good but I'd probably trying something else when I go back!Mildreds was a fantastic experience and I will definitely be going back. It's literally a 5 minute walk from Oxford Circus station and you can go on to lots of bars around it after!! So pleased we went and would highly recommend!"

Quite frankly I wish I hadn't bothered. Our train had arrived late into London so my partner and I arrived at the restaurant about 20 minutes late. The rest of our party was there and had explained that we were delayed to staff so when we arrived we apologised again to the staff and sat down to say hello to our friends and look at the menu. Literally as soon as we sat down a staff member came over and started taking orders giving us no time to read the menu properly and, as we were clearly being hurried, making a hasty food choice which was hardly the best start to a nice relaxing meal and certainly not how I wanted to start my 40th birthday celebrations. Unfortunately this hurrying us along wasn't an isolated incident there wasn’t a single part of our meal when we weren’t rushed by staff or made to feel like we were being awkward or acting as an inconvenience to them. Furthermore, my friends had thoughtfully brought a surprise birthday cake to present me with after the meal but when they arrived they were immediately told by staff that Mildred’s didn’t allow birthday cakes and that the staff wouldn’t be able to assist. When my partner was told this he went and spoke to the staff and the end of the meal Mildred's did deign to bring out my cake but at a charge of £15! I've eaten at restaurants all across the UK and I have never known any restaurant to charge a table for bringing out someone’s birthday cake, in fact most restaurants are happy to do this for customers to help them celebrate, to maintain good customer relations, to make their customers feel valued and to encourage them to stay in the restaurant longer. I am shocked that Mildred’s Camden charged us for this when all other restaurants are more than happy to do this for their customers for free. At this point with all the drinks and food that we had consumed our party had spent almost £300 and no doubt would have spent more on drinks after the meal had we not been feeling so rushed by staff. The food itself was very well presented and was well cooked but the choices weren’t mind-blowing or particularly innovative and I’ve eaten at vegetarian restaurants with far more interesting choices. I can’t help but feel that Mildred’s, although perhaps once a great choice for vegetarians and vegans, has started to believe its own hype rather too much and has now gone the way of so many other restaurants and is all talk with no substance.It’s also quite clear that Mildred’s Camden do not value their customers and in fact seem to find them an inconvenience rather than the essential element that actually keeps the restaurant in business. The whole experience with Mildred’s has left me feeling incredibly disappointed, very upset and has managed to taint my 40th birthday celebrations. As I said earlier, I had heard great things about Mildred’s and was so excited to finally have the opportunity to visit but after this experience I will never visit Mildred’s again and will certainly not be recommending their restaurants to anyone. I did actually e-mail the restaurant to voice my concerns and disappointment but they have blithely chosen to ignore the feedback and haven’t even acknowledged my e-mail let alone reply which further proves just how little they respect their customers."

Got seated in the main area. First impression is that there is going to be a really long wait as there are so many people waiting just inside the door. For lunch this is a bit misleading as the takeaway dishes / orders are all being filled in a self service buffet in the bar area. So that is why you need to push through to the corridor and speak to the serving staff and book a table. For lunch we had a 5-10 minute wait (we were just 'off peak' at about 1:30 / 2pm) We had two visits here (based on the good experiences of our first visit.)The food is excellent. Had the fennel sausage and mash, stir fried vegetables, a coconut curry special and black bean rice burrito. All vegan and all superb we cleared our plates.We saw lots of other great looking dishes such as the burgers (they all looked good) with chunky sweet potato fries) and the desserts were fabulous. Big enough to share, especially after such a generous main!Note: we enjoyed the food so much we tried to have dinner here as well. The wait for a evening meal was over 45 minutes and we declined each time. My recommendation for evening is to allow enough time, or get a table / booking number and leave your mobile details - then pop to the pub for a swift half or three...This is a really busy restaurant, and the serving staff all do a great job - the staff apologised for the wait on our first visit (it took about 20 minutes for the food to come out) but the food and dining experience was definitely worth the wait!"

Got a table almost straight away which was excellent and placed order quite promptly. It all then went wrong. Ordered some breads, starters and mains. Also some drinks. One drink arrived and then the starters. After a few reminders the other drinks arrived but the moment was already lost - no sign of the breads. Starters finished and then the bread arrived. After a short wait two of the mains arrived. After about 5 minutes managed to catch an eye of a waiter who politely asked what was missing - although that should have been painfully obvious. Two Stir Fry had been ordered but only one arrived. Eventually a second arrived but about 50% of the quantity of the first with many components missing. This was obviously bits and pieces found in the kitchen to make up a meal. Very disappointing. Obvious the waiter was aware as he came to the table and advised we would not be charged for the second stir fry. Appreciated - but totally missed the point and would have preferred a meal. Will not be back again."

Me and my girlfriend recently attended Mildred's restaurant (23/3/16). The bar staff and host were good, the waiter was fine and the food was good. I paid with a voucher my sister had given me for Christmas 2015. The waiter collected the voucher, he was fine with it. I noticed some activity surrounding the voucher by who I assume was a senior member of staff, so I asked if everything was ok. I was told the voucher had been adjusted and was asked to present my receipt again.At this point I offered to call my sister but was told ""It's ok"". Well, at that point things weren't really ok. Firstly, I didn't appreciate having to present my receipt again after the waiter had already been satisfied that the voucher covered the amount on the receipt. Secondly, digital vouchers would be more suitable, as they would prevent many issues leading to suspicion. Thirdly, a digital record of vouchers would prevent an empty search through a handwritten organiser that led to further suspicion. Mildred's may be the oldest veg restaurant in town, but you don't need to use outdated admin methods.The voucher was issued just before Christmas 2015, so it seems illogical that it could have expired in little more than a week, as implied. Also, my sister raised the issue regarding the way it was written at the time of purchase and was told it would be fine. The fact I was asked to show my receipt again makes me feel suspicion was definitely directed towards me. The lady was clearly checking the amount, after the waiter had already accepted the voucher as cover for the bill. If the manager was just checking that the voucher was ""recorded"" correctly I wouldn't have been asked to present my receipt again. A voucher isn't a free meal ticket, it's a receipt of purchase. You let down your brand and your junior staff who performed so well and wouldn't be able to treat customers the way you did."

Fantastic and comprehensive all vegetarian menu (difficult to choose just one!) in a well decorated small interior. We sat inside under the sun roof and it was beautiful. Loved the illustrations on the wall! So yes super busy with the gorgeous salad bar for the lunch crowd doing take away and in summer to the parks, but if you can get a table would recommend it for the great atmosphere. Had a great waiter also, even in the lunch rush. Very close quarters however, so if that isn't for you, I recommend salad bar or after 2pm."

I was all for moving my family on but a fellow queuer told me to have a drink from the foyer bar and wait, ""it will be worth it"". A waitress came, took my name and gave me a numbered ticket. I enjoyed the wait, the chatter with my fellow queuers and the well-ordered busyness and bustling of the place. We were shown ere long into an upstairs room. This is a moderately priced vegan and vegetarian restaurant and what a varied and mouthwatering broad selection of meals was available. The food was superb, the service comfortable and unhurried. As we left after an hour or two we wove a path through a similar huddle of hearty folk, waiting patiently for their chance to enjoy Mildred's. What an experience, I can't wait to return."

By the time we finished we had to almost wriggle our way out through the crowd of people queuing at the bar and waiting outside to get in. Subsequently Mildred's Soho has become a regular take away venue for lunch and from the comments coming from our office colleagues when they see and smell what we are eating, they will soon be adding this venue to their lunch list.In summary, different, very popular, very good value for Soho; try it."

Being a person used to eating meat and fish, I will quite skeptical, but when I looked at the menu and saw the comfortable interior I am really amazed and impressed. The restaurant building is roughly 3 storey levels high but when you go upstair for additional seating, please mind how you go as the stairs are quite steep and there is no lift. Apart of that, the top level has very comfortable seats and the dark wooden tables and simple layout makes this restaurant very welcoming. It has all the designs to what you would find in a traditional pub, but this is a special place that has been established for years, which goes to show what surprises you will find in the city of London. We had halloumi and samosa for starters, which were our favourites, for main, try the veggie sausages as I guarantee for they will fill you up really good otherwise it is best avoided if they want to try desserts such as apple and raspberry crumble or the rum cake. Ice cream is also served here. Cocktails, soft drinks, wine and beer can be ordered with your food or separately at the bar on the ground floor. Mocktails are available, if you want to taste exotic drinks but without the alcohol although choices are limited. It is best that you come around 5 or 6 in the evening to get a table if this is always busy at the lunch hour and late dinner and you can't make any reservations. My eating experience here was great and we had all enjoyed our meals very much and I would recommend giving this wonderful place a try even if you are not strictly vegetarian."

They have crammed so many tables into the room that the distances between tables is roughly 6 inches... this means every time your neighbours move, you either get a backside in your face or the inconvenience of having to move your table to make space for them. For the hour I was there, my seat and at times my head, was nudged or knocked almost constantly as waiters/waitresses rushed back and forth in the small gaps. The starter we had was OK, but nothing special. I had the samosa and I didn't see how this differed from anything I could microwave at home.The main meal however took 50 minutes to arrive since they forgot or messed up the order. Only when they finally delivered this did someone tell us what happened and they removed the 12.5% service charge from the bill as a result... given that this is my choice to pay, I don't consider this as a suitable apology. By this time, the noise and the heat of the atmosphere, plus the constant assault everytime someone walked behind me, just left me feeling resentment... after half hour waiting, had they told me of the problem I would have asked them not to bother and just left then.The only reason that they made it to 2 stars is that they make a good cocktail.Absolutely certain that I would not eat here again."

Unfortunately, like most institutional food, it leaves much to be desired. I want to like Mildred's, I really do. But I hadn't been for about ten years, because my last visit was so very mediocre. But when a friend suggested it, I thought it was about time I gave it another go. Sadly I probably won't be going back for another ten years, it was still mediocre. The menu is fine, but not exciting. Just typical vegetarian-option fare - vegetable curry, risotto cakes, pasta, a beetroot burger. And when the food came, it was fine too. Nothing wrong with it, but no better than I could cook at home. So all pretty average. But are the prices average? No, they're way WAY too high for the quality of the food. And the ambience? Crowded and noisy, with a tired decor. The tables are so close together that you have to move them to slide out, holding your coat and bag high to avoid it trailing in your neighbour's food. No private conversations here.It's really not worth it. Tibits is only five minutes walk away and is so much nicer. Go there instead."

The star of the show was a very decent gzoya dumpling. Unfortunately a steep downhill descent followed this with an Amy's Kitchen £1.99 quality frozen burrito with tinpot salad, a burger that looked like it was made out of playdough and didn't taste as good as this classic child's plaything, a £3 bowl of McCains oven chips and also somehow ended paying £4 for sweet potato chips?! Say whaat. The service was non-existent however they add a 12.5% service charge (jokers) and I spent my meal smooshed between 2 couples either side. I felt like I was eating my meal in a greasy spoon with somehow less leg room and space to manoeuvre. Overall, I'm so glad that i spent £65 on a meal and 2 cocktails I could have cooked in my oven at home for £8 with a chilled bottle of Lambrini. As someone that doesn't eat meat that has been getting a bit bored with samey veggie options I was looking forward to a menu full of food I could eat. Unfortunately I ended up with the most average food I've ever paid for. Never again."

We achieved one of those - the quality time together. We arrived at 10pm and were told it was a half hour wait which was fine. We expected that. What we didn't expect was the shambles that followed. Whilst waiting for our table we placed a drinks order at the bar adding it to our 'tab'. The drinks hadn't arrived when we were seated and when we asked our waitress about them we were informed that they no longer had the ingredients. This excuse was used for the next three drink choices. We ordered our food - a main each and some humous to share to start. My partners main came first followed by my main a few minutes later. However, the requested cheese was missing. Upon pointing this out to the waitress my plate was taken from me to have the cheese added. This was fine, except it took them 10 minutes to add the cheese. By which point my partner had finished his food. The humous never showed up. My food was tasty, but very greasy. When the bill arrived we had been charged for the humous, despite not having it, and drinks that they hadn't had the ingredients for. These were finally removed from the bill. The place lacked atmosphere and was more a case of the blind leading the blind. If they work on their service and improve the meals this would be a great restaurant. Instead I'm going to stick to the better ones that I know are out there."

But last night we only wanted to quickly smash a brownie and there was a lot of space at the front/bar area, however we were told 'we cannot let you eat dessert here because if we do it for you we have to do it for others'. Sorry, but that is an unreasonable response at the end of the night when firstly no one was walking past to 'witness' us breaking the rules, nor should it matter! As a veggie/vegan restaurant, their ethos was all off and they were entirely unwelcoming or accommodating. I wouldn't go back to that branch."

She was advised to go to Mildred's and she dragged me with her. It's right in the heart of Soho in a very narrow building. They don't take reservations and the place was packed, but we decided to wait for the 40 minutes necessary to get a table. There is a small bar area and we found two of the few seats. Just because vegans don't like to eat a lot of the things most people consider necessities (bacon for example), doesn't mean they don't like to drink. There were a lot of good cocktail choices and the bourbon sour I had was so good I had a second. My daughter's peach bellini also needed to be tried twice.For mains my daughter did better than I by choosing what essentially was a vegan version of bangers and mash. If you closed your eyes you would swear it was a sausage you were eating and not something concocted to taste like sausage, I was less fortunate with a sweet potato curry which was good, but not great. Maybe a vegetarian would be more impressed.The dessert I had more than made up for the somewhat lackluster main. The sticky toffee pudding was so good I forgot to take a picture of it until it was gone.The wine was good at a fair price and the service just fine. I would not describe the dining area as 'airy' as they do on the website. It's packed very tight.The crowd here obviously tends toward the younger set - 25-35 mostly, casually dressed. Prices are very good for what you get.I'm no expert on vegetarian restaurants and don't plan on becoming one, buy I would not hesitate to recommend Mildred's, but have the faux bangers and mash over the curry."

Had a carrot, apple, beetroot, ginger and lime juice that was divine; starter of buffalo tofu, crumbed and fried with buffalo sauce, crudite and blue cheese dip (vegan option); main course organic detox salad with beetroot, carrot, sultanas, sprouting and toasted seeds in lime and ginger dressing with marinated tofu; and finally, apricot and apple crumble with custard (vegan). Everything was extremely well flavoured and fresh tasting, and it seemed that no matter how busy they got the food came out on time – promptly but not too quickly.

I also added the samosas which was a starter at the end of the meal. They were good too. The mango chutney was good. Not the most amazing I've experienced but better than most Indian restaurants standard supply. For main I had the Sri Lankan curry. This was tasty and very fragrant. I do find Sri Lankan curries to be like that compared to Indian curries. A bit like a stunning Thai to a not so impressive Chinese. The main meal portions are not huge though in my opinion. Well the curry wasn't. So value for money for that dish is questionable. I will be returning though as I've a menu to try out! Very popular thou. The queues are crazy and waiting times too if you choose a bad time to arrive!

I had delicious vegetarian sausages with mash and gravy, kale, true comfort food and would suit a meat-eater. Husband had the recommended stir fry, the flavours apparently became more interesting the further he dug into the bowl! Then just as we thought every thing was looking up, the apple crumble we ordered to share did not materialise. 20 minutes later, full of apologies and again no charge, we could finally finish our lunch. So 10 out of 10 for quality and flavour, ingredients etc., and even for putting things right, but service was definitely strangely lacking today, I get the feeling it was just our bad luck, and we are not put off returning"

Now this in most places would be seen as a negative, but the reason it isn't here is because the food is definitely worth waiting for. I'm not a veggie although I rarely eat meat, but the food is fantastic. The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is always buzzing.

Located in Lexinton Street in Soho, you cannot book so expect a wait! It was a busy Saturday afternoon and we had a table upstairs which is accessed by a somewhat circuitous route. The place was thronging, testament to the great food - although at times it was so loud it was hard to hear our conversation. We had the Virgin mules - excellent with the tang of the fresh ginger; Shri-lankan sweet potato curry, black bean and tomato rice burrito and the tomato sausages - all ample portions and well cooked - the curry probably had the edge although the sausages were also superb. For desert STP, crumble and the coconut panna cotta- the latter being the star and the STP a little disappointing - too heavy and not piping hot. Rounded up with coffe and peppermint and camomile tea. Over all a great meal - not a place for a quiet or romantic meal but if it is hearty vegetarian fayre in a buzzing setting this is THE place to go."

The good news is the food is still ace! The bad news is last night the staff were not so ace. First; after being told the table would be an hour and half wait (fine) they gave our table away after an hour ( we were waiting outside as it was to crowded in the bar). When we did sit down they didn't give us the specials menu. They took ages to take our order, every thing was PLONKED on to the table with no care or attention, my meal came about 10 mins after every one else's. Then the waitress at the end accused us of under paying the bill...when we had not. We spent a fair amount on dinner last night including two bottles of higher priced wine, and enjoyed every drop and bite, but the service was a real let down, especially as usually the staff are so nice! I really hope this was a one off, and hope to see the staff smiling again on out next visit. Hint ;)"

The portions were a generous size, and so much of the menu tempted me, deciding what to order was a tough decision to make. This was my first experience of a purely veggie restaurant, and I think it's an amazing way to introduce people who are die hard meat fans. The food was well presented, smelt delicious, tasted divine and left me stuffed. One thing I would say you can't book, and we arrived at 530 on a Friday, by the time we left at 630 you couldn't move there were that many people and wait time was over an hour, but it's really worth it.

The dining area is very small and you will be seated very closely to your dining neighbours, again something that didn't bother us as we quite like most humans :-) but if you have oodles of shopping you might want to off load at the car...or eat first!! :-) I will return when I am back in London...great tasty food..thank you!!"

It was ‘shared’ though which meant we had 3 other people sitting at the opposite end, but we didn’t mind. We were up two flights of stairs in a little room with a fireplace which was quite nice. It is such a luxury to go out for dinner and have an entire menu of different options to choose from, as opposed the static and uninspired ‘veggie burger’.My vegan sister had the stir fry, I had the black bean burrito and my other sister had the curry. All were delicious and very filling. This may have been because we ordered 3 starters beforehand to share. The samosas and gyoza were fab - so tasty!We really wanted dessert but our stomachs wouldn’t let us which was such a shame. We completely over indulged, and all plates were spotless!Will definitely be going again to try some of the other dishes and pudding next time!! We really need more places like this around London!!"

Don't get the pie!,"Visited here for a date night and it was great! We turned up at 6ish on a Friday and there was no queue but a swarm of people arrived straight after us. We didn't have to wait because we were willing to share a table with another couple which was completely fine (but would've been around 40 mins if we wanted our own table). For starters we got the purple corn tortilla with guac and the flatbread with dips. Both were really yummy and there was a generous serving of guac. For mains I got a burger (can't remember which one!) with vegan cheese - DEFINITELY SKIP THE VEGAN CHEESE (an extra £1). I've tried lots of vegan cheese and this wasn't great at all, but after taking it out the burger was delicious! My boyfriend got the mushroom and ale pie and he normally loves all of those things (mushroom, ale, pie) but nether of us were a fan of this. A friend of mine also said when she visited she didn't like this either so it's definitely not a crowd pleaser! The absolute best thing about this meal was the vegan brownie at the end. It was really sweet and chocolatey (which I LOVE) and I will definitely be returning for the brownie alone! Good food (if you choose well) and really friendly service!"

Last time we went, we had each a different version of the veggie burger, receiving it in a fried bun was a great disappointment - it felt so unhealthy and wasn't worth it. Service was a hit and miss, but i think the problem was mainly with our waitress, cause the other staff was quite attentive. My friend who had the smoked tofu burger wasn't feeling very well afterwards which raise the question whether something was wrong with her dish. Btw green juice was very tasty"

We ordered the pie, chips and peas, which is favourite of ours . We got about 6 chips, a small portion of mediocre peas and a pie in a dish served on the plate with the chips and peas which took up a lot of space looking like the plate was filled, but when the pie was removed and put on the dinner plate the meal was very poor and expensive at £11. I complained to the waitress who started laughing, until I told her I wasn't joking, she told me she would pass on our complaint but nobody come over to see us. I think Mildred's has always been popular and the meals were good but now they have now got contemptuous of their regular customers and are serving poor quality dishes at inflated prices.

As we were waiting for a few of our friends to arrive (you can't be seated until everyone in your group has arrived) there was space to sit and have a drink at the bar. We had the tomato, mozzarella and parmesan risotto cake with grape mustard sauce, wilted spinach and green beans which was really delicious and filling. Also had the pumpkin, ricotta and sage tortelloni with wild mushroom, marsala cream sauce which again was great - the portion size looked smaller than the risotto cake but it's a rich dish so we did feel very full after both dishes. There is so much choice on the menu, I'd recommend a visit just be prepared to wait for a bit!"

We've heard so much about it, but the no-reservations policy has always been a sticking point. Being vegan, we often have difficulty finding suitable food at non-veg restaurants, and frankly turning up and not being able to get a table for an hour would be a huge hassle, so we haven't even tried before. However on this occasion we wanted food at about 3pm, so we figured we would get a table without too much bother, which we did. The serves we could see on tables around us were massive, and we weren't that hungry, so we ordered a range of light bites to share between the two of us. The hot chips were lovely, as was the smashed avocado dip. The rose harrisa hoummus was AMAZING and the gyoza dumplings were DELICIOUS. Because I have always wanted to try a vegan crumble, I then ordered the vegan berry crumble with custard, which was sadly a bit bland. The staff were friendly and efficient. The place was packed - when we left there was a queue out the door. I'm glad we were lucky enough to get a table right away - we must have picked just the right time! Overall, it was a good experience and I will probably go back, but I would time it carefully as I hate waiting in queues. If it was possible to reserve a table, I would be sure to go there more often."

As a non veggie married to a veggie for over 20 years , I can say that my experience of vegetarian food in specific veggie restaurants has been traumatic at times as often the menus have been devised by the evangelical painted shoe brigade , and can be, shall we say, a bit specialised. Anyway I need not have worried , the food was delicious. We had , houmus , Babba ganoush and flat breads to start veggie burgers , tofu for me and the Polish for her and sweet potatoe fries , followed by crumble and custard for desert and a brownie for my better looking half. With a beer and a glass of wine each , the total bill was pennies over £50. The staff were courteous , knowledgeable and attentive at all times . I can't recommend this place highly enough ."

My friends love it, but I feel like I must be in some kind of alternate universe to them. This evening I went with a friend. We queued for an hour (fair enough- we chose to wait!) and had drinks at the bar to fill the time. The bar staff were SO RUDE. They steadfastly ignored everyone waiting with massive scowls. When one of the guys finally took my order, he made my drink in a rush and slammed it down in front of me without saying anything. When we'd been seated, our waitress was completely disinterested. After a lukewarm starter, I ordered a burger and when it arrived it was just literally a burger on a tiny side plate- no fries or salad or sauce or anything! Never experienced anything like it at £8. I think I was maybe supposed to order fries as a side? But the waitress never asked me, and on previous occasions I've been they came with the burger. So bizarre! Then to cap it all off, they overcharged us for the bill. I don't really understand people who say the food is inventive either... It seems pretty ordinary to me!"

It was a busy lunchtime, but we got a table straight away (and if we couldn't, it was clear people were coming and going quite quickly so it wouldn't have been a long wait.) What I loved was the massive vegetarian choice (well, it's a veggie place!) so picking something to eat was a treat in itself and it was NOT the usual veggie lasagne, tomato-pasta(yawn) sort of place... all the dishes read on-paper as really interesting individual creations that had been put together really thoughtfully. We made our choices, and were not disappointed with the food... the dishes were as good in real life as on paper.... delicious!!!!! Looked lovely, tasted fantastic. Throughout, the staff were friendly and attentive and we were never left hanging at any point. We loved it so much, on our second day in London we went back for ANOTHER visit and had altogether different dishes, and those too were fantastic.

That is good and bad at one and the same time of course. I will declare that historically, I am no great fan of vegetarian food. Still, we've been 4 times this past year and the food and throbbing atmosphere I get. The choices are varied, reasonably (not good) priced and the green smoothies etc. delightful. I warm to the endemic LGB vibe and you should be aware that it is queer friendly. In July, one (white) couple from overseas finding themselves seated next to a gay black & white, inter-generational pairing indicated through their body language that this was unwelcome, if not distasteful. For our part, seated just the other side this juxtaposition represented no more than an amusing distraction. Less so perhaps the undaunted gay pair, until they sussed we too loved the colour lavender! That said, conversely in September I ate lunch again, with a close male friend. Across from us were a large, seemingly hetero family, of different ages. I can report that they were also from overseas on vacation and as oblivious to us, as we otherwise were to them. My one abiding rub with Mildred's is that I could generally eat twice what they proffer and that pertains to both main and dessert courses."

For main I think everyone must try the curry- it was heaven, full of flavour and a great size portion. The Panna Cotta with salted caramel for dessert hits the spot as it is light but perfectly sweet. Cocktails are inventive and although Mildred's is small it has a great atmosphere. You should be prepared to wait 45 mins- 1 hour for a table on an evening, even mid week but trust me when I say it is worth the wait. There are little stools and a bar at the front so you can have a natter whilst you wait. I am excited to hear they are potentially opening another Mildred's in Camden so I eagerly await any news on that!"

I found our table very light and airy as there's a sky light in the roof...The menu isn't the biggest menu I've come across but there really seems to be something for everyone - curry, Asian, traditional, Middle Eastern...We picked the gyoza and rose harissa hoummous/babaganoush/flatbread to start with. I am very particular about gyoza and these got my approval - crispy bottom, tender wrap and tasty filling. The flatbread was slightly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and the dips were very flavourful and fresh.I ordered the stir fry veg for my main course - red peppers, bok choy, baby corn, broccoli and tofu that wasn't quite silken tofu and wasn't quite firm (but delicious!) served on whole grain rice. The sauce was described as ""shiitake, mirin, chilli, garlic and ginger"" - I can't say that any of those flavours except he garlic particularly stood out but the sauce was very nice. I would have loved to have seen some actual shiitake mushrooms in the dish.We skipped pudding and my friends opted for coffees. Unfortunately by that time it was so busy that it took quite a while to get the coffee and the milk and sugar they asked for was completely overlooked.All-in-all it was a good meal but felt that it was too busy for the staff to be able be consistent with their service.Pros: tasty food, good variety in menuCons: cramped, gets too busy for quick service or 100% attention from your server, doesn't take reservations"

I think I definitely need to go back and try again as maybe it was just an off day with the food or the food items I chose.I had the vegan burger - I cannot for the life of me recall what burger it was but unfortunately it was very bland. I'm used to very flavoursome, spicy burgers so perhaps it's just my personal taste. My partner had the burrito which I'm told was very nice, this cost approx £11.I must admit, all the food coming and going from the kitchen looked and smelled fantastic. Next time I will try something a bit more adventurous.The space is very small and crowded - it's quite nerve wrecking getting in and out from your table for fear you may knock over the drinks/meals of those dining near you.The venue however is nice.

The seats by the windows are great at that time of the evening as you can do lots of people watching and get the summer breeze.Once our table was ready we were taken through to the buzz of the main restaurant where staff were busy tending to diners with great energy and professionalism. The staff here are fabulous and know everything there is to know about the ingredients and dishes and really love sharing that. Our meals were spectacular, tasty, fresh, innovative, beautifully presented and we were able to eat at our pace without being rushed through courses. It made for the perfect birthday meal. My boyfriend expressed his own joy at his meal, that vegetarian and vegan food does not have to be stodgy, boring, purely vegetables, it can be exciting and full of flavour if the chefs know what they are doing and have the passion for it. He was as satisfied as I was and that makes me incredibly happy."

I had been wanting to try Mildred's for a while so whilst in London with my former vegetarian friend we went here. It was fairly busy , and being not a big place, it turned out to be a squeeze. I was carrying a big bag with me and managed to knock the table with a jug of water on it, tipping the water all over the empty seat. The waitress was quick to pick it up but following this, quite abrupt and rude. We ordered our food which was unbelievably delicious and so very filling. I had the polish burger with the blue corn chips and it was safe to say I was very satisfied afterwards! I was so shocked to see that every single thing on the menu was vegan or had a vegan option, despite the waitress not being very enthusiastic about it when I asked to double check the order was dairy free. We had the chocolate peanut butter brownie for afters which was out of this world! Vegan and wheat intolerant or not, you all need to try it! It is hands down one of the best things I have ever eaten. The huge let down of the trip was the staff, not only were we not given a dessert menu when asked for it, despite making eye contact several times with the waitress who quite blatantly ignored us, but then I addressed another member of staff for a menu, she threw me one and said 'it wasn't me you asked'. I honestly did not see any of these girls smile the whole time I was there, which was a fair couple of hours because we were ignored for a large amount of the time. I asked about he cookbook afterwards as I am a lover of cooking myself and due to the response of the waitress, I didn't even buy it. She was so blunt and rude about it, she clearly hates working there which is a shame as the food is delicious and so well thought out for us intolerance sufferers and vegetarians. Prices were excellent too. I paid £17.50 for 2 courses and a side and left with a very happy and full tummy."

There is a good range of choice on the menu, which is always good for a vegetarian restaurant, but I don't think the quality of the food would justify waiting an hour for a table.Luckily, on both of the visits, we were seated straight away. I visited yesterday (Saturday) for lunch, and found most of the staff to be inattentive. There didn't seem to be any system about who was serving which table, so when we had been seated and chosen what we wanted from the menu, we then had to sit and wait while around 5 members of staff gathered around the till to have a (clearly non work-related) chat.The person who took our order then managed to get the drinks wrong (pretty impressive for a table for two!), so the food had arrived before the correct drinks had. We ordered one of the fresh fruit juice blends, and although we both ordered the same juice they tasted completely different...I have also read comments about how noisy the restaurant is, understandable when there are lots of tables packed into a relatively small space. However, the staff were making more noise than the customers yesterday, another sign that they weren't really taking the job seriously. Having visited twice, I think I would now rather try to find a vegetarian restaurant in London that can provide quality food alongside quality service."

Drinks came pretty fast and our order was taken. To say the place was busy our meal came very quickly.Wow! The flavours! The presentation! I had the Thai curry which is the best veggie curry I have ever eaten, just totally delicious. The hubby had the mushroom pie. To say he usually has a streak and ale pie it came as a total surprise when he said it was the best pie he'd ever eaten and would eat it again! Desert was cherry truffles for me, just something small and sweet but again, gorgeous. He had sticky toffee pudding and demolished the lot. What more can I say? If veggie food was this good everywhere no one would even want to eat meat! Try it, you won't be disappointed!"

The food wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't worth waiting the hour an a half we queued for. The halloumi and hummus starters were both nice but then it's pretty hard to get halloumi or hummous wrong. For mains the menu promised a scrumptious sounding sunblushed tomato, mozzarella and parmesan risotto cake. What we ended up with was bland and average at best. The sweet potato curry we ordered was pleasant but again nothing memorable. The staff were friendly but the service was very slow and they got our order wrong (and the table next to us). To their credit they did offer us an extra dish for free. If you're planning on queuing for hours to get in, my advice would be don't. At best Mildred's is worth a visit at a quiet time. There is some absolutely amazing vegetarian food available in London for half the price and minus the long wait. Mildred's is ok but in my opinion doesn't deserve the rave reviews it gets."

We both had the tofu burger which was absolutely delicious, I had the kale juice which was beautifully fresh and we had a side of smashed avocado with the blue tortilla chips and some fries.

I feel more effort goes into the food to make it tasty and interesting that a restaurant that serves meat and rely on the meat to make the dish. The best dish I have ever eaten here was the tortellini with pumpkin and truffle oil - it is truly an experience. The truffle oil takes it from a tasty dish to a very decadent dish. The cocktails are fabulous with a mixture of traditional and Mildred's own to choose from. A great wine list for vegetarian and and vegans. Some people would be put off by the long waiting times - however try a cocktail! As the perfect gift I cannot wait to purchase the Mildreds book for a special vegetarian friend.

We arrived at about 5.15 as we knew about the queuing. Didn't have to queue at all as we agreed to share a table. What a squash! The noise of raised voices trying to make themselves heard combined with the clatter of plates was deafening. Impossible to have a conversation. (Perhaps this is the 'nice buzz' others refer to and I'm just an old fogey). The waiting staff were fine, but disinterested and the whole atmosphere was one of rush and pressure, both of bodies and getting orders. We waited fifteen minutes for our order to be taken and longer for our cold starters to arrive, though our plates were cleared the moment we finished and mains came quickly.The food was superb, but our special occasion was nothing of the sort as it was impossible to relax and converse over our meal and we felt pressurised to get on with it.

Within 15 minutes it was full however.Main server guy very friendly, guy who took our order not so but no matter.Smallish menu which suggests they focus on quality rather than providing every dish under the sun.I plumped for the black bean burrito (£11)- deliciously flavoured with satisfying side salad, salsa, sour cream combo. My only slight criticism is that this 'large plate' left me slightly hungry. Perhaps I'm just a fat get but the inclusion of a side of mexican rice would have made this perfect.My wife had the halloumi burger (£7) and a side of sweet potato fries (£4). Simply she said it was the best vegetarian burger she ever had. It looked stunning I have to say. We note that the burgers are available for takeaway- a very tempting proposition.Overall a lovely meal."

I wasn't sold on this place being someone who likes a good steak when dining out. We sat basically touching arms with the people next to us and I began to grump to my girlfriend about what she had got us into! We ordered the Homemade Antipasto for a starter to split and it was very enjoyable and very fresh. Main Courses: my girlfriend had a Wild Mushroom & Ale Pie that she cleared the plate with and hasn't stopped raving about since. I went for a halloumi burger with chargrilled aubergine that I genuinely would have had every night in until we left. It was lovely.I asked for the bill expecting it to be insane London prices but was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices. Well worth it for all the food and drink consumed!Can't wait to go back next time we're in London.Doug.

Our table was in a busy thoroughfare and we felt we had no room for the variety of small dishes we had ordered. The table next to us became free and with no one to ask we decided to move over and were immediately more comfortable and a little bit off the beaten track of the waiting staff.Almost immediately we were verbally and publicly rebuked by the waitress. Raising her voice she told us that she had saved the table for other customers (no reserved sign) and that we had no right to move without permission. We were surprised at her tone but explained the we didn't think we had done anything wrong, we preferred the table position and had more space. She didn't want to let go of the issue and pointed to two people waiting. I asked if they wouldn't like the other table which was still free, after all we had been there for at least half an hour already. The waitress didn't reply and just walked away. We asked at the end to speak to a manager but no one was available. I wrote to the management who replied that they felt that the server had been justified in her behaviour and was a well respected and long-standing member of staff. We did not doubt that but there was no excuse for her rudeness to us. We felt humiliated and embarrassed in front of so many people."

My friend managed to secure us a place in the queue, and the wait to be seated was standard for these type of popular restaurants. The food was absolutely delicious, (I had a hearty portion of the Sri Lankan sweet potato curry, my friend had the mushroom pie, and we both finished on the delightful world peace dessert!) so enjoyable and faultless, however the service was quite slow. Not a massive problem as I was enjoying a catch up with my dinner companion, but after waiting approx 15-20 mins for a second drink after a surprisingly hot mouthful of curry I ended up cancelling it as it seemed to have been totally forgotten. The waiter who dealt with the queue and seated us was lovely, however the other members of staff were a bit sullen and not overly friendly and this aspect could be worked on to improve the general dining experience. Would definitely recommend for the food, but suggest going at a time not so traditionally busy to get the best service, and perhaps not if on a deadline (for theater etc)"

Finally had a waitress turn up to take our order and when one of the three of us didn't tell her immediately she said ""back in a minute"" and disappeared. Came back with pen in hand and took the rest of his order. When the third of us found out the dish she wanted was not available, she looked at the menu again to decide and the waitress tried to tell us she would come back in a minute again. I had to ask her to stay for 10 seconds while a decision was made! Who is effectively paying her wages? If she's so busy then get more staff who can deliver decent service. So the cocktail arrived, followed by all the food and then I had to ask for the rest of the drinks, the same happened to the people at the other end of our sharing table. The food was pretty good though expensive for vegetarian food, all under seasoned but we could fix that. When it came fine to pay I very nearly asked for the service charge of 12.5% to be removed as the service was severely lacking, though decided not to. Has to wait ages for the bill and then the only time the waitress smiled at us was when she said goodbye. It felt like she was wanting to say good riddance, so I will not be returning."

The first time I went to Mildred's I had the Sri Lankan sweet potato curry with roasted lime cashews, pea basmati rice and coconut tomato sambal. The next time I had the classic burger: smoked tofu, lentil, piquillo pepper in a sour dough bun with relish, rocket, red onion and tomato/with vegan cheese. Oh did I mention I live in Sweden. If I live in England I would for sure be a regular customer. Every time I go to London I will be eating here, that is not even a question!"

I've only been a vegetarian for a year now but I tend to eat out regularly and have realised a lot of 'vegetarian options' lack thought. I found Mildred's through searching for vegetarian restaurants in London and it was pretty highly rated (I can now see why). It's a very intimate little place, the venue itself isn't anything too special and you are 90% likely to end up sharing a table with other people, once you've queued for around 45mins (Monday evening) to get a seat (you can't reserve).However, it's all worth it because the food is fantastic!Would recommend everything I've eaten here and also what my non-vegetarian dining buddies have had too; The halloumi burger, the beetroot burger (chips that come with are next level), the curries.If you're looking for a vegetarian restaurant, or even just a place that serves delicious food, around Soho and you have time to kill/don't mind sharing your conversation over other people then I would 100% recommend."

Within half an hour they were packed out and I can see why, the food was simply amazing. It was all so fresh and absolutely packed with flavour, the menu changes on a regular basis so there will always be new reasons to return! I may be biased having been a vegetarian for 11 years but even my boyfriend said that their food made him think about converting.

However, when we went last month we were rather underwhelmed. The decor is now looking tired; the tables are far too close together for privacy or comfort; the menu now looks very dated and unimaginative - if I'm going to what I still was thinking of as something of a flagship veggie restaurant, I don't want a veggie burger taking up space on the menu.It now feels more like a quick in and out cafe serving basic veggie food but at restaurant prices, rather than a nice casual restaurant as it used to be. The service was also a bit of a struggle. Finally, the journey to the toilets isn't an attractive one.Overall, I feel Mildred's either needs to have a major rethink or gradually go downhill. Shame."

I can recommend the white peach bellini as a very pleasant summer cocktail.We were asked if we would be willing to share a large table in one of the private dining rooms upstairs, and that was fine with us. After having the room to ourselves for about 15 minutes we were joined by three young women and it was no imposition to share the table.The decor is quirky and eclectic, and we were soon ooh-ing and aah-ing over the menu. We shared a few small plates to start - olives, flatbread with houmos and babaganoush, and fresh spring rolls. All were delicious.For mains we had the mushroom and ale pie, the risotto cake, the sri lankan sweet potato curry and the burrito. All were excellent - clean plates all round.Desserts were also wonderful - the vegan raw chocolate cake and the summer pudding (both of which were specials), and the persian spiced lemon and pistachio polenta cake with pomegranate and rosewater sauce.The only things that could be improved are the toilet facilities (only one male and one female toilet, and not tidied up frequently enough it would appear - a bit grotty), and the service was a tad erratic. We had to wait a long time between being given menus and ordering; also we shared a bottle of wine between the six of us and said at the time or ordering that we'd probably want to order a second bottle before too long... but we had to wait until we were ordering dessert to give our order for the second bottle as we hadn't seen our waitress for a long time. Also, when the desserts were brought, one was missing and we did wait a good 5 minutes before the missing piece of cake was produced.I should say that our waitress was very friendly and pleasant, and was able to answer questions on the food very capably. It's a tricky set-up for staff - clambering up and down stairs all night, so we appreciate service is not as prompt as a one-level restaurant.We'd definitely return to Mildred's. Two of our party are not vegetarians but very much enjoyed the food and had their eyes opened about modern vegetarian food."

I visited with two meat eaters who also really enjoyed the meals they had and didn't feel as though they missed out not having any meat. This is not the cheapest food but neither it is the most expensive. The only slight negative I would say is that the 'café' feel of the place lets it down just a little.

As the fab teenager is vegan and I am a vegetarian it is always tough to find something to suit us both. The fab teenager had this restaurant ear marked for a visit and what a visit. The restaurant is really lovely, you can't book, but we were never waiting longer than half an hour for a table, and there is a nice little bar and seating so you can have a drink and peruse the menu. The restaurant itself is bright and has some lovely artwork on the walls. Staff are fabulous, very friendly and I still miss Michael!! Now to to the food, it is something else, you would never miss meat and i'm not a great fan of giving up dairy but if I lived near Mildred's it would be no problem. We went for lunch and it was so good we hung around Oxford Street until we were hungry enough to go back for dinner!! I got the most amazing coconut and sweet potato curry and the fab teenager had a burger that she still talks about three weeks later!!! So whether you eat meat, don't eat meat and the same with diary, Mildred's is the restaurant to go , no matter what your preferences. Sit back and the let the staff guide you through a menu where you will always wish you had a bigger appetite. The only downside (and its so picky) some may find the tables a bit close together but it seriously made it more fun as there were a couple beside us who said that they could not understand vegans or vegetarians and they both cleared their plates and ordered desserts... none so queer as folk!!Going back in December as we want to bring "" he who must be looked after"" to savor all that is Mildred's. Keep us a seat Michael.Jackie"

We can’t all be perfect.That said, I’ve heard so many great things about Mildred’s from both veggies and carnivores that I had to try it for myself and was actually really excited to see what all the fuss is about.After a 25 minute wait, and one Aperol Spritz down, we squeezed ourselves onto a tiny table which clearly was never designed for anyone who’s eaten a bacon sandwich, and pondered the menu.I have to say, there was so much here that I couldn’t wait to try; babaganoush, homemade antipasto, gyoza, flatbreads – the list is endless. Well, until you get to the end of the menu.We opted for mashed avocado with lime and chilli (guacamole to most of us) and blue corn chips as well as Mediterranean vegetable fritto misto as a starter. I must admit, I really want the recipe for the deep-fried artichoke and broccoli stems – the buttermilk batter gave such a crispy texture far better than any other fritto misto I have had, vegetable or fish, and the lemon aioli it came with was a perfect match. The guacamole was also delicious, although could have had more chilli – I find I often say that in most of my reviews however, so maybe I’m just a spice fiend.As a main, I opted for one of the specials; pea and mint tortellini in a cream sauce with broad beans and fennel. This was a really great pasta dish, but I don’t want to big it up too much at risk of feeling like I’ve been cheating on my old faithful, Carluccios’ Penne Giardiniera, which you just can’t beat.My friend went for the halloumi burger, which is where things became unstuck. When she ordered the burger, she mentioned that she was gluten intolerant and therefore didn’t want the accompanying flatbread, to which the waitress just grunted and walked off. I was sure that as somewhere which caters to a lot of eaters with intolerences, that this kind of restaurant would definitely have gluten free bread. I was right. Ten minutes later a really nice waiter came over and asked if she would like some – a saving grace. When her food arrived, the halloumi was thick and had a rich, golden colour, and the side sauces (harissa and tahini) were delicious. However, this seriously lacked some freshness – a freshly sliced tomato and some red onion would have definitely lifted the whole thing.Overall, the food on offer here was ok, but I couldn’t help but feel very disappointed with the service and lack of attention, so we’ll be visiting one of the buffet veggie venues next time (Ethos/Tibits), at least there you can see what’s on offer before you order it, and you don’t have any grumpy waiting staff, unless you’re in a bad mood of course."

The absence of meat and fish isn't made any big deal of; the menu is short but all sounds great and choosing is difficult because I wanted pretty much everything and that was before I saw the specials. The food when it did arrive was excellent - I must have remarked many times throughout the meal how good it was. Tasty, fresh tasting and generous portions and not super expensive (albeit not cheap either). The burgers and sweet potato chips were a particular highlight. Queuing system in operation as no bookings but wait wasn't excessive albeit we were there early doors. Staff good - feels a touch chaotic on arrival but they were assiduous about making sure people were seated in order. Otherwise service pretty good. Turnover on the cramped dining room is high but we weren't made to feel rushed. Would definitely go back and looking forward to doing so."

We did eventually manage to order a dessert to share between two of us, plus a takeaway for a colleague. They brought us the takeaway brownie and ice cream in a box, but ours was nowhere to be seen! So while the ice cream was melting we waited. And we waited. And we waited. Until we eventually gave-up and asked for the bill, and our brownie also as a takeaway. Despite the fact that they were providing awful service we only received a brusque apology after we made it clear how unimpressed we were.

The staff seemed very rushed and very brusque in their manner which was a shame as this was a birthday celebration. The table was not wiped down after the main course which left us rather sticky.The waitress had to lean right over us all to clear glasses etc although we tried to help.

Quinta a small place but well designed. As a result tables are squeezed together but this adds to the atmosphere.The food is very imaginative with several specials for all courses. Good salads of course, but my favourite was a Polish Burger based on beetroot which was delicious, accompanied by sweet potato chips. Very low GI!Nice starters for sharing as well. The gyozo were good but I'd have preferred a spicier sauce. Well-prepared artichokes, and good desserts.A Small well-chosen wine list but I'd recommend one of the juices.All serving staff were friendly, informative and well trained."

I can't stand the staff attitude. They are never friendly and I get the feeling they look down on you. I wish there were more competition around town, so we could have a choice, instead of having to go to this place. I know it's been around for ages and it's probably the only non-indian veggie/vegan place in the West End, but I really think they have rested on their laurels. They can afford to as there is really no competition. I hope someone else comes along soon to give em a run for their money."

We went on Saturday and we thought we were being tactical going at 2.30 because Mildred's is without fail always busy at lunchtime and dinner time. It was the busiest I have ever seen it on a Saturday afternoon and only started to get quieter after 4. Just goes to show how popular this place is. Fortunately we didn't have to wait too long for a table. The food was up to its usual high standards. I had the beetroot salad to begin with which was amazing, it tasted so fresh and there was a nice balance of flavours with the feta and hazelnuts. Next I had the risotto cake which is my all time favourite dish. I think it is the sauce and the bean shoot garnish that make it extra special. For desert I had the cherry cheesecake which was nice. I do miss the white chocolate and pistachio cheesecake they used to do, it was my favourite cheesecake ever! I would be delighted if one day it could make a return to the menu."

The food was good, but rather disappointingly the whole experience was ruined by a rude, arrogant and obnoxious manager (his name was Hugo). I will not go into the details here, but the way he treated us was completely over the top and unnecessary. Having read the reviews on Tripadvisor and other similar sites, it seems to be a common theme for this restaurant. Hugo also seems to have a track record of treating people poorly. We wrote an email to the owner (Jane) but unfortunately she did not even acknowledge the problem. Both Jane and Hugo seem to be more worried about Mildred's future expansion plans, rather than providing good and friendly service (in the restaurant when we complained about Hugo's poor attitude, he even rather arrogantly told us what a successful business Mildred's was and has been for 26 years and that apparently they are opening more branches). Best of luck with that, but none of us will be going back to Mildred's again, and we will not be recommending anybody else to do so either."

I stumbled across Mildred's and decided it looked as nice as any other place and other reviews had been very positive.. So, Saturday 2nd May 2015.. We arrived at Mildred's and found we could hardly get through the door! That's always in my eyes a good start.. The bar was great if small and the diversity of people was great as well.. Name down for a table and told to expect a 70 minute wait.. In the meantime we took to the bar for some of the best cocktails I think I've ever had... Then our table is called and a menu in front of us which made it hard to choose from! Settling on Veggie Gyoza and Halloumi for starters and moving on to the Curry for main... Words almost escaped me when eating their food. It was subtle, beautifully cooked and absolutely amazing... I could have revisited the menu over and again and I can't believe anyone could suggest vegetarian food is boring! We will be back in the future without question. The staff were fantastic and we left satisfied and half cut from the alcohol but regardless the place deserves a Michelin star!!! Seriously... Don't miss out!"

My friend and I decided to meet up during his 1-hour lunch break but I'd arrived earlier than him. I was hoping to snag a table for two as it was getting busy for lunch time and I knew we'd be stuck in a queue if I didn't. Despite it not really being allowed, the waitress agreed to let me grab a table and wait for him.She was equally attentive the rest of the time, never forgetting to check back or ask if we needed anything else despite the place being packed.While she was really nice, the food we had come for was extremely disappointing. I had the stir fried Asian vegetables in a shiitake mushroom sauce. Medium-sized portion but SO SALTY. I couldn't even finish it. I tried my luck at a dessert, to cleanse the palate, choosing the maple pecan pie with vegan vanilla ice cream. As someone who grew up in Texas, I've got to tell you: that pie was very disappointing. Too sweet and otherwise bland; couldn't taste the maple or pecan flavour inside the pie. Nowhere near what a pecan pie should taste like.At £17 it was pretty expensive for what it was and was totally not worth it. Will not go back again - would rather try other vegan restaurants in the area."

I had to ask for a menu, and no one came to take my order until I asked a very pleasant blond young lady with glasses. She was the only decent member of staff here. Another older lady with wavy hair was brusque and unhelpful when serving me.The food however was fantastic. I had Asian stir fry vegetables with green salad, followed by chocolate and peanut butter brownie with vegan ice-cream. I ate every bit....it was quite delicious. Would I go again? For the food definitely, but the service, (apart from the lovely young blond lady with glasses) was quite appalling.

The service wasn't very personal at all and to add 12.5% service charge on the bill is too much considering they did nothing. Therefore we did not pay the charge. To be honest we would go back because the food was just out of this world and so nice to try new things as a vegetarian myself. However, the staff should really look into the way they treat customers because the lack of customer service lets them down."

Nice to see a few new dishes on the menu. I had the kale vadis, very yummy and the spicy chick pea and fennel tagine special. The service was slick, quick and non fussy. Nice to see 2 burgers as a choice and most exciting the launch of the cookbook. I've pre ordered mine so will be able to have Mildred's 7 days a week."

We had a mexican starter and I ordered the Stir-fry with brown rice. The mexican starter had us all fighting over the food. Even though it is only meat for two people all four of us we're satisfied with the amount we got. Moving on to the stir-fry. The vegetables we're cooked to perfection and the tofu was really tasty. After finishing my meal I felt pretty full. As always my Girlfriend couldn't manage her meal, getting full to early. And as always I gladly finished it off, but at quite a push. You really do get a filling meal for what you pay. After all finishing our meals, we we're all satisfied. One of the friends who was not a vegetarian even made the comment that he ""might turn vegetarian after that meal""!To conclude:-Excellent service -You get, way more than you pay for-Brilliant variety of mealsThanks for topping off my girlfriends birthday!!"

Both were incredible and it felt like a real treat to eat out again, which I feel I'd lost a bit since become a vegetarian.We sat in the upstairs area which suited us much better than the downstairs which was a bit too noisy for my taste. As it was my birthday, my friend arranged for a candle on the vegan pecan pie they brought out as she sang 'Happy Birthday' to me. Delicious - I couldn't believe it was vegan!

Starters would be large enough for a small appetite but the mains are not to be missed, especially burger of the day (beetroot when i had it: full of flavour and well-balanced). Although the menu doesn't always change regularly, this can be comforting as the stalwart dishes remain popular for a reason. Also, the wide variety of cuisine available at Midlred's means there's always something to tickle your fancy. The wine list is very good and waiting staff have always been extremely pleasant and knowledgeable; the style is swift and friendly, young and hip but with no reservations (metaphorically and literally). You can't book but tables are managed very well so waits are normally not long... mind you the cocktails are so tasty that noone will grumble about sitting at the bar until a table is available. The upstairs area is more secluded and can be booked for bigger parties. All-in-all an excellent place, fabulous value and right for many occasions. You can eat quickly without feeling you've over-indulged or stay longer for a special meal with no risk of being pressurised to leave. Well worth multiple visits."

Nine of us were meeting for my daughter's 29th birthday and, as you are not able to book, we were advised by a helpful girl on the 'phone that a couple of us should turn up a bit early and wait at the bar for a table and for her guests to arrive. We arrived about 20 minutes beforehand but were greeted by an obnoxious manager (Hugo I think he is called) extremely unhelpful who said that he would put us on the list but could give us no idea how long we had to wait for a table until all guests had arrived. He said we would be squashed on a table for 6 (which we were not told on the phone when enquiring) and was totally uninterested so we walked away. I subsequently discovered that another of our guests had visited previously with her boss who had also walked away because of staff rudeness and yet another of our guests had eaten there before (and it was he who had recommended the food) and said that the staff had been indifferent and pretty rude then. None of us shall return. It may be the place of the moment but won't be for much longer if you treat customers in this way. We went on to Jackson and Rye in Wardour Street and the staff couldn't have been different. it was just as busy as Mildreds but they were charming and helpful, yes we still had to wait for a table but they couldn't do enough for us and the food was perfect."

Just can't give that, I don't think it's a 4 I'm sorry. The restaurant is cute, theres a great vibe, went Friday night can't book but waited 45 mins at the bar downing some lovely well priced pornstar martinis. Seated on a table for 4 with my 1 mate and 2 randoms. I'm from London so wasn't too weird but my friend is from up north and the cosiness of this wasn't ideal for him. Anyway being a total carnivour i chose this place as my mate is veggie, and I was being nice. I thought the food was really decent actually, starters were lovely: tortelleni and fritters. Well priced. The mains , I had the Sri Lankan curry which again was tasty, he had the haloumi burger and chips and wasn't impressed. Remaining drinks were good, except the bloody Mary which was basically neat tobasco and overall 30 quid each Inc service was not unreasonable. 1 thing, they were really busy and most the waiters and waitresses were lovely. 1 however was useless, took my drinks menu off me after being asked to, didn't bother to ask if we wanted any drinks...didnt just ask for the menu to look at it now did I! And the icing was him hitting me on the head with an empty bottle, fair enough mistakes happen, but you could apologise rather than just walking off. Anyway had a word about him, he didn't ruin the evening anyway. So I think for a pure veggie place a meatie like me wouldn't be dissastified, but not sure I'd go back in a rush too soon. Nice food, great atmosphere, cosy at its best, lovely cocktails, it's a 3.5 :p"

Neither of us are vegetarian but loved the food. The menu is just the right size and there is a good selection without being overwhelming. I had the Sweet Potato and Coconut Curry which was absolutely fantastic and full of flavour. We both had a cocktail which was pretty weird (Gin, Prosecco and Lemon) but went well. I had the Cheesecake for desert and wasn't that impressed - a bit stodgy and the crust wasn't crunchy enough. Our bill was £60 for two which I thought was reflective of the quality of the food and this included service at 12.5% which we were happy to pay as our waiter was good. We did have to wait about 15minutes to order after being seated but as it was the weekend I didn't mind as we were not in a rush. I could also see how busy the place was.I'd like to visit again and try one of the burgers or the Burrito - definitely try and go at a weird time though, I can't imagine how long the wait times must be in the evening and room inside is limited so you'd probably have to queue outside."

She said it would be at least a 90 minute wait to be seated. We added our name to the list … but really, who in their right mind would agree to wait for 90 minutes to be seated for dinner?

We've been coming here for years, and still return - the menu is varied and there are always specials to try. Wine is also good. Been here at different times and I'd say the best time is early evening before it gets overwhelmed. No reservations so if you get here around 8ish in the evening and it is busy you might need to be patient. We've recently arrived at 9pm and were told a 45 minute wait, but this ended up only around 20 minutes or so - we'd only got halfway through our Negronis. Not cheap but a great treat to not have to pick your way through a menu and have what you want. You'll probably end up sat close to other people, but when no one is eating meat or fish that's fine - as long as you're not too shy."

First no reservations. You show up and put your name on the list. The lovely bar staff will make the time pass quickly with lovely cocktails. I had a Bellini and by the time it was done we were sitting down. Second this is a very crowded space with lots of hard surfaces so it is noisy and you will be elbow to elbow with the party beside you. That can be a good thing - we had a grand time with the couple beside us. Third the food is wonderful. My appetizer was an Asian tofu fritter dish that was beautifully done with a nice bit of heat. The main I chose was the burger of the day - a beetroot and bean burger that was somehow held together without a ton of egg. Wonderful. The maple pecan pie was a bit disappointing but Canadians have high standards when it comes to maple!Well worth the wait and definitely a place we will return to.

The restaurant was heaving as always. We were greeted prompty by a friendly waiter, who said a suitable table would be available shortly as the previous guests were just settling their bill. We ordered a bottle of the house red from the bar area, we went for the house, at £19 a bottle, it's reasonably priced for an organic red. They'd run out of wine glasses so gave us tumblers, that's fine by me, i like drinking it that way any way! We all had the pumpkin tortellini with truffle and mushroom cream, it was absolutely devine! The pasta is clearly homemade, and had been well prepared and was silky soft. We didn't get puddings as there was nothing that appealed on the menu, they used to a gorgeous Cambridge cream, with shortbread, i hope they put it back on the menu again soon! Mildreds continues to be one of my favourite places in London, my only criticism is i wish they would shake up the main course menu a little, they've been serving the same stuff for years!"

My eyes roll in the back of my head when I take that first mouthful, the soup is exquisite, the cocktails STRONG, the hot chocolate, decadent. The gentleman who takes you to your table (after the 2 hour wait - because this is the best place in London) is polite and wears fabulous jackets, maybe with or without a beard - he will get you your table if you wait. He'll also make sure your service is good enough from the stressed out staff who literally cannot cope under the pressure and sheer demand this place has on a continual basis. The quips between staff correcting each other are in themselves worth coming for. The ravioli is stunning, layers of flavours and so filling, delicate but hearty, wholesome and dainty, impossibility on a plate.The juices are squeezed freshly, always with something bizarre added to them - always delicious and gone within 2 minutes, you will need to order water because the juices will go too soon, so will the cocktails. The price is stunning - such good value. So tasty. I'm literally salivating writing this because thinking about Mildred's has a conditioned reaction in me to want the food so badly, immediately. I'm not at all exaggerating. At all. Eating is believing. You'll have noticed I didn't even mention so far it being vegetarian. That's because the food is beyond being a good vegetarian restaurant - it's the best restaurant in London that I've been to."

The portion was big but we also had to order dessert because there were so many gluten free and also dairy free options! We got the chocolate brownies with peanutbutter frosting, chocolate sauce and tofu ice cream! It was the most perfect meal all together i have ever eaten abroad and i will definitely return to this restaurant when possible! The service was friendly and quick, atmosphere fun and prices were reasonable!

It was very busy and there was a queue to get a table. You can't order a drink at the tiny bar until you have registered your presence and are on the waiting list for a table. Fair enough but the bar is very small and not an ideal place to enjoy a drink while you wait for your table. The other option is to get a rough idea of when your table may be available and to then go elsewhere for a drink. The member of staff managing the queue was obviously under pressure and was somewhat brusque with the waiting people. The situation is compounded by the fact that tables cannot be booked in advance. I cannot comment on the food but the experience of the process of getting a table and the limited bar area does not encourage me to go back and try again."

Mildred's is one of a small number that I go back to again and again. My meat-eating friends love it too. They have a wide selection of dishes, many of which are also vegan, and specials that change regularly. It's quite small and usually very busy. You can't book, which personally I like because you know they will always find somewhere for you eventually, but may not suit everybody. You can have drinks or snacks at the bar or outside while you wait. The staff are great - really laid back and friendly even when the restaurant is heaving, and service is quick and efficient. A lovely place to go for dinner in Soho."

We are both veggies but I am gluten free too. We arrived after 9.30pm as the website advises but did have to wait a while.Despite this the friendly staff kept us updated on where they were with a table for us and we enjoyed cocktails in the bar. The bar has a lively feel and but was a great place to drink and chat. The menu catered well for my gluten free needs and there were specials on the board too. My sister had mushroom Wellington and I had the Sri Lankan curry. Such good service from waiting staff and lovely food makes this the best veggie restaurant we have ever been too.

Got there early and managed to get a table. I tried ordering a Jameson's and gingerbeer, but turns out they don't have any gingerbeer, no lemonade or no sprite. Followed by my next drink, they have no JD, so had to settle for a mixture of the two. But apart from the fiasco, the food came out pretty quick, was very tasty, and we enjoyed our meal. I would expect more from the staff, not once did anyone come round and ask if everything was okay, i mean even Nando's do that!Overall good food, good atmosphere, decent price apart from the 12.5% optional service charge that's already on my bill, but would still recommend based on the food!!!"

We ordered the soup of the day (lentil) which was excellent, as was the bread that came with it. For mains we had the black bean burrito and the stir-fry Asian veggies. It was all great. Portion sizes were substantial, so we definitely left with our bellies full. As vegans, we were pleased with the number of choices on the menu.

I did not like this restaurant for few drastically annoying reasons!! - Absolutely disgustingly loud seating area. It was as if I was in a torture room. The tables are too close and people laugh right in to your throat. Completely uncool.- The ambience is overtly pretentious. - The staff is alright, no complaints about them.- The worst cocktails I have ever had, especially the bloody mary. - The starters were fine but the mains were awful to say the least. I can cook better than the food they served, even if I am blind folded! The problem with such pretentious vegetarian restaurants is that they come across as too hung up on being hipster friendly.

Although being a vegetarian restaurant, every meat-eater that I have brought to Mildred's has loved the food, and they also have a large number of vegan options.On arrival, we were able to get a table for two straight away which was great. You cannot book at Mildred's unless you have a large party, so you often have to wait to be seated. This makes perfect sense though, as with their Central London location they are always busy, so if they worked on a reservation basis, if people did not turn up then they would lose custom. I'm personally always happy to wait outside with a glass of wine to be seated though, as there's a nice atmosphere.We were provided with our menus and some water straight away. As we were catching up, we were not ready to order immediately, but we were not pestered to do so. However, as soon as we had decided what we were having, we quickly ordered our food and a bottle of wine. There are a number of vegan food options, as well as vegan wine choices.Our starters arrived quite quickly which was great. Unfortunately our bottle of wine still hadn't arrived though, so I reminded the waiter when the starters were brought out. I had the thai fritters (£6.25) which were delicious, and my friend had the crostini (£6.50) which she also really enjoyed. Good portion sizes and fantastic flavour combinations.After we finished our starters, a different waiter came to collect our plates, but there was still no sign of our bottle of wine. I asked them if they could please bring it over, and this time it was brought over quickly after the request.Our mains were again delicious. I had the mushroom and ale pie with sweet potato fries (£11.75). The fries cost a little extra, but they're worth it! I would also recommend asking for the vegan mayonnaise. This is not standard mayonnaise, and has a really delicious flavour, ideal for dipping your fries in! My friend had the aubergine tagine (£9.75) which she thought was wonderful. Again the portion sizes are very generous, and we were so full that we didn't need desert!For our two starters, two mains, a bottle of wine and the service charge (12.5%), the bill came to £57.65, which is a price I would expect for a Central London restaurant.The waiters are really friendly, and the atmosphere is great. However, the fact that it is always so busy means that service can sometimes be a little slow, or items can be forgotten. However, the quality of the food and the friendliness of the waiters mean that I have always really enjoyed every visit to Mildred's, and would always recommend it to others."

We were greeted warmly by the host, and had just enough room to sneak in a great-tasting, well-priced cocktail at the bar. On a busier night you'd probably end up stood out on the street and with the weather (and roadworks) at the moment that isn't really ideal.We were told to that our wait would be around 30 minutes, and around 30 minutes later we were seated. Now the busy ambiance of Mildred's is both endearing and somewhat of a downside as well. The downside comes from the fact that at times you're constantly grabbing at your wine glass trying to stop it from falling on the floor as somebody accidentally knocks into it as they try and get to their seat.Now on to the good stuff: the food. We ordered a Middle Eastern platter for starters which contained falafel with tahini, spanakopita and pita bread along with some dips. These were tasty, flavorful bite-size pieces which gave you just enough to make you look forward to your main course but not be too full to enjoy it.The main courses themselves were the real star of the show. Between us we had the mushroom and ale pie (with mushy peas and chips) and the fresh tortelloni filled with pumpkin and ricotta. Both dishes were rich, fresh, warm and incredibly delicious. But most importantly they were both incredibly filling which is what you realistically want from main dish that costs between £9-£11. The service throughout was attentive, checking if we needed any more drinks or if they could clear the recently used dishes once we had finished. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience, and like my first experience at Mildred's, I'd definitely eat there again!"

Its awesome that London is fast becoming a vegetarian diners dream.However, there is still only one place in London that I have kept returning to time after time. Mildred's is the best modern vegetarian cuisine in London with a delightful menu, lively atmosphere and excellent service and attention from the wonderful team.My favorites for starters and mains are the - panfried halloumi, cherry tomato and wilted spinach with balsamic glaze - surprisingly light and sunblushed tomato, mozzarella and basil risotto cake with wilted spinach, green beans and grape mustard cream sauce - deliciously rich in flavor. Every dessert is fabulous - a must try.The only downside is that it's always busy and most evenings you will have to wait for a table - but this is testimony to the scrumptious food that is dished up to perfection every time. Another shame is the baby sister cafe - Mrs Marengo's has been no more for years - wishing they open that again as the takeaways where awesome."

One dish was bear petect and the other hugely disappointing. The risotto cake with mozzetella and sundries tomato was unfaultable, however, the tagliatelle with goats cheese and sweet potato sauce was hugely disappointing and quite frankly a waste of £11. The dish was ordered nervously as pasta in non specialist places can be a let down and a let down this was. Massive chunks of sweet potato just look like meteorites in the already carb focused dish. The notion of sweet potatoe and goats cheese sauce led me to believe it would be a blend, not a ridiculously stodgy and untasty dish. All the more disappointing as I'm sure there are other awesome dishes that we missed out in for this damp squid!!!"

I think it's amazing to see a veggie restaurant doing so well so I am thrilled to see it packed every time I visit. I've been visiting Mildred's for over 15 years since it was in the previous premises in Greek Street. The food never disappoints and service is quick and friendly. I love the varied vegan options - the gyoza dumplings are my favourite starter. The burger of the day is always great. And I especially love the vegan cheesecake for dessert (pls bring back banana and maple!)I will continue to come here for years to come. Just make sure you arrive early if you don't want to wait for a table! Plus the restaurant is currently not open on Sundays.

You will rarely find it quiet and if you want a quiet hidden in the corner table this is unlikely to be your first choice. However, if you want the finest vegetarian cuisine, with excellent staff and a great atmosphere then this is for you.I have eaten here several times and Mildred's has become my ""go to"" restaurant in London and I am not a vegetarian. I have been lucky enough to have eaten at some of the so called best hotels and restaurants around the world but this is a gem.

That said, I think they can get away with that because they live up to their excellent reputation of excellence in the small niche of vegetarian/vegan restaurants. I hear a new restaurant is being opened, some maybe that will alleviate the pressure for seats. Still a bit of credible competition might get them to revise their policy. OK Rant over.

The restaurant is a relaxed cool atmosphere but the tables were close together and staff were rushed, nevertheless the service was good. I had the risotto cake which was delicous (menu has changed since), dessert was the chocolate peanut butter brownie, which was pretty immense. A must go if your in Soho, as it's worth the wait and you won't miss the meat!"

Also it doesn't accept reservations. We were seated quickly and once we ordered the food came quickky. Great Sri Lankan curry really enjoyed. Great vegetarian menu with so much variety. I think we were unlucky but we seemed to have been forgotten and other newer diners were served before us. It wouldn't stop me going again as food speaks for itself. Also as there is a queue waiting for it to open it is frustrating that some people choose to queue jump.

The menu is completely vegetarian and also has many vegan items which is a rarity in central london. The staff were very pleasant and quite helpful. They don't take bookings so expect a long queue if you go during peak hours, had to wait 45 minutes although at least the staff gave you an accurate wait time unlike a lot of other places where they underestimate so you don't go somewhere else.The food was average to be honest. There are many other restaurants which serve better veggie food even if their entire menu isn't veggie. We ordered the mexican platter for a starter and were left a bit disappointed. The guacamole and the retired beans tasted of nothing. The quesadillas were overly sweet because they had mango in them. For the mains the stir-fry was exquisite, better than most chinese restaurants i've been to but everything else we ordered was okay. The mushroom pie with peas was tasteless but the chips that came with it are probably some of the best i've had. The aubergine and chickpea tagine was overlyspiced with cinnamon and didn't taste of much else. I think they need to play around with the recipe for this because it could be improved significantly. The restaurant itself is actually quite small and so it gets very noisy and cramped at peak hours. Although it is possible to have a relaxed meal with friends, i wouldn't go here if you are on a date. On the bright side the price was around what you'd expect to pay at a chain restaurant so at least you don't feel like you've been fleeced for what was an average meal."

My partner and I wanted to have a special dinner and one that catered to my vegetarian and special diet needs. We did the research online and decided that Mildred's would be the place! Not only did the menu and location in the heart of Soho seem appealing, but the restaurant was also open on Monday evening--the time really best for us in planning the celebratory dinner. The restaurant had an upbeat, urban vibe, clean in design, and delightfully laid back, yet still pulsating with the energy of its clientele and its fun, friendly, and knowledgeable staff. Our waiter was a delight! We had no problem finding great drinks, a tasty appetizer, a healthy, flavorful dinner, and very amazing desserts that weren't saccharine with sweetness. From start to finish, it was a lovely experience. A somewhat quieter setting with a bit more space would have been nice, but that's not what Mildred's is about. Seating is tight and the restaurant fills up, but it was so good we didn't even mind being seated next to another couple we didn't know. Part of the ambiance of a small urban specialty restaurant. There is incredible competition among dining options in the Soho area, and probably among restaurants that focus chiefly on vegetarian options, so it speaks well of Mildred's that it was bustling and busy on a Monday evening. People were having fun and enjoying the drink and savory selections. We would definitely make a return visit!"

No bookings are available either. The only option is to turn up, take your turn in the tiny front of house area, and try to get a drink from the bar there to tide you over until a table is free. When you finally sit down, either on the ground floor, or, quieter, upstairs, you can expect friendly service, an interesting menu, with Eastern and Middle eastern influences. Not cheap, but worth a visit if you want a meat free meal that is not just a cheese omelette. And if you are vegan, and therefore leaving eggs out of the equation, there is plenty of choice."

The facility itself is nothing fancy, but it bustled with activity - often a good sign. The seating was somewhat crowded by Canadian standards. The service was prompt, friendly, and accommodating. The food was fantastic from the appetizers to the main. This year I returned to London, and Mildred's was on my 'to do' list. As always, it was quite busy, and since they don't take reservations we put our names in the queue. We had drinks and chatted outside only for a short time. This time our group of 6 was seated upstairs in room with more of a dining room feeling; It was lovely. The food was consistently delicious! Curry, pumpkin ravioli, veggie burgers, grilled artichoke...mmmm"

I changed tactics and went for lunch, which worked out well. The restaurant was full but not 'crowded'. They have rather small tables so be prepared to move things around. The food seems adventurous, fun, vegetarian... but with the exception of a few dishes with strong flavour it definitely did not live up to the hype my friends were serving. The biggest disappointment was the service, TERRIBLE! After going back and forth a few times about what we had actually ordered the wrong food came, went, and came back about 4 times. With all of the fuss I would at least expect one of the two... excellent service or excellent food...I got neither. Definitely give it a go but dont expect to leave a vegetarian."

My only complaint used to be that they never had enough space and that we could not get in without a long wait sometimes. Sadly that has changed. My companion turned up a little early (we were on our way) and asked for table for three. The waiter in a burst of New York style self importance refused to tell him how long we might have to wait until the other two people had arrived at the venue. Once we had shown ourselves he was willing through somewhat gritted teeth to add us to his list for a 45 minute wait. Unsurprisingly we went somewhere else.

He told me to pick a vegetarian restaurant so I looked online & found Mildred's & liked the look of the menu & the reviews on here were great so we decided to go for it.We were completely disappointed. We waited 1 hour 45 minutes for a table & yes it was a Saturday night but we were originally told we would have to wait 45 minutes so we decided to take a walk & come back after 30 minutes. If we knew how long we would really be waiting we wouldn't have come back. After 1.5 hours of waiting we were offered a table to share with others which we declined but once we were seated on our own table (which was absolutely tiny) we realised we may as well have gone for the shared table as all the tables are pushed so close to each other. On one side we had a 1.5 ft gap between our table & the next & on the other side 6"". We could very clearly hear conversations between both couples either side of us so if you do go here there is no point opting for your own table - just take the shared one if it comes up sooner as it makes no difference anyway & there are no private tables in the restaurant.On each table was a vase with water in which I think is a nice touch but the vase was very dirty all around the neck & I was very hesitant to make use of it.Once seated we were served pretty quickly & ordered starters & mains straight away as it was getting pretty late. The food came out promptly (10 min wait for starters; 15 for mains) & was nice but not outstanding. I then ordered a dessert which took about 35 minutes to come after ordering & they provided us with two dessert spoons one of which was very dirty so my boyfriend complained. Getting the bill was just as difficult as getting a table in the first place & dessert - there are not enough waiters around to ask although we did manage to get ones attention eventually.All-in-all I wouldn't go back - the food just wasn't good enough for the wait & they don't have a booking service. The food wasn't bad hence they've managed to redeem two stars from me but this is not a restaurant to relax in. My boyfriend & I were hoping to go to Leicester Square after dinner but we were exhausted as it ran so late & we were left feeling stressed out from the bad service. Honestly can't quite understand all the brilliant reviews on here... I would advise only going if you have PLENTY of time or for lunch."

The restaurant is packed and seating is rather close.. its definitely not a place where you can go relax and have a nice leisurely meal. I ordered Fried Haloumi as starter which was promising but in patches it was burnt and rubbery. For main course I ordered Tangine and couscous with fried aubergines.... I did not find any aubergine in my food plate and I have definitely had better Moroccan cuisine in London. All in all the food was rather disappointing but for the company I had (an old school friend) and the pleasant service it would have been a waste of a visit.

The venue in the heart of Soho has a bright and clean decor and the staff are very welcoming, though it's clear they are rushed off their feet and the place is frantic and cramped. You need to just go with it - the bustling, intimate nature of the place and enjoy the cracking vegetarian food they have on offer. One of those menus where you want everything on it. This isn't pretentious, small portioned, mean food. This is big, hearty and flavourful. They do what they do well. Veggie burger? It'll be the biggest and best veggie burger you've had in a while. We tried the risotto cakes and the smoked burger of the day which was smoked beetroot. Couple of delicious porn star cocktails as well. They delivered dessert to our table by accident and let us keep it. I got the peanut butter brownie which was too dry and cakey but I think it was vegan or gluten free, so we can forgive it for that. To top it off it's competitively priced at around the £10 mark for a main. For the quality and quantity well worth it."

The dishes are vegetarian masterpieces and for all you veggie eaters this is the place to take your carnivorous friends as it's the place where ""You don't miss the meat or feel that something is missing from the dishes even if there's no meat on the menu"".

Oh dear, my partner is a real carnivore - in her mind a meal without meat is a crime. This is going to be an interesting meal.....A quick search on Tripadvisor flagged up Mildreds. It is everything people say it is.Arrive early and be prepared to wait as it is so popular.I found service to be very good although the initial welcome was professional but a bit stressy as they tried to figure out where to seat us. Once seated the service was absolutely first class. I found the surroundings to be very elegant.The food was absolutely fantastic and so fresh. It feels so healthy. The food was delicious and easily satisfied the carnivore.Everyone has different tastes but I am surprised at comments of blandness. Tastes differ. I guess some people don't like the taste of vegetables or theyprefer everything to be nuked with chilli or garlic. If so then don't go to Mildreds as you will get a creamy light curry with coconut milk and not a taste-bud blistering curry. So, to make it clear what my tastes are and where I am coming from: In my case I need to eat meat but really like veg - I'm not a fan of fruit. So my review does have a slight bias towards vegetables but I also love a really strong curry so my taste-buds are not the most sensitive. Make your own judgement.I think you will struggle to find a better vegetarian restaurant than Mildred's. Not only do I recommend it - I really want to go back soon."

It was terrible on the night my friend and I attended. In particular, the really camp waiter who thought he was a on catwalk and kept strutting it throughout the restaurant. Slightly annoying start to our evening. What tipped it off was when he told (not asked) my friend to move here bag to the other side of her because the empty table was being filled. I don’t see why she had to move her bag because it was in the vicinity of our space in the restaurant. On top of this, there was a period when there wasn’t a single waiter around for about half an hour. Looking around, we could see other customers who had finished their meals and there were empty plates all round. It shouldn’t have taken the staff that long to clear the tables.

It is so refreshing to visit a restaurant that truly understands how to make a wide variety of delicious and nourishing vegetarian food.The service and staff were fantastic and provided great recommendations. Also the food was impeccable. Not to mention fantastic value. I have eaten at places twice as expensive and half as tasty!My personal recommendation would be to make sure you save room for desert (great range of eggless/vegan options as well). I am not a huge desert fan but the chocolate/peanut butter desert i had was to die for.I will certainly be going back to Mildred's - I have finally found a place that I belong!

Despite not being a vegetarian, this restaurant is one if my fave in Soho. The staff are always helpful and are accommodating to your needs.

The beetroot and chilli feta dip are amazing! My diners got the burrito and risotto cake, the latter of which I would highly recommend! We also shared some sweet potato fries which were great but maybe a bit greasy. I would highly recommend Mildred's!"

You are in for a long wait for very ordinary cafe food. Dont get sucked in by the hype. I will feel sorry for all the poor victims standing in line every time I walk past MildredsWe went on a slow night and were sat down within 30 mins which is apparently very quick. We managed our expectations but still all you will get is a place too small, too packed, too rushed and then too bland when your meal arrives.We ordered all the coveted highlighted dishes from the 100's of excellent reviews. 1) the Mexican Share platter which was a cheese quesadilla and corn chips served with guacamole and re fried beans - this apparently is delicious according to most of the reviewers.... really? what have you been eating your whole lives? Veg food doesnt need to be so bland and simple. Not one thing on that plate was any better to the same items purchased on a party platter from Tesco. 2) the Summer rolls were boring bland and forgettable I don't think we even finished them3) Pumpkin Tortellini was the best dish of the evening I would give it a 5 out of 10 and we finished it - result! 4) the Mushroom Ale pie which apparently they are very proud of: I am no chef but I could have made that dish in no more than 20 minutes at home. I will not comment on the mash or mushy peas that came with it because they were just lamentable and stodgy. They offered us dessert but to be honest we knew we had been sucked in and cut our losses, we got ice cream on the way home which was the highlight of the evening. FYI it is considered acceptable practice at Mildreds for the waiters to knock your chair or table every time they walk past you because ""its a small space and we have to fit everyone in"" We sent one of our drinks back because it was the wrong one and we also never got our side dishes.........BUT NONETHELESS THEY WERE ON THE BILL AND WE HAD TO GET THEM TAKEN OFF BY A BEGRUDGING WAITER. Please dont ruin your night... if you really need a veg meal then go to Tibits on Heddon St or your local Indian restaurant where any dish will destroy the whole menu at Mildreds"

It's loud and the seating is tight. Note: The bar doesn't serve anything but bread and olives so you can't order apps while waiting. The restaurant seems popular with younger people. There was a large group of young people next to us who were incredibly loud and obnoxious. Even though we were only a group of four it was very hard to hear what we were saying even though we were sitting next to each other.  Service: The service was ok. The hostess and the server weren't the most friendly.  Would I go back? Yes, but I would go early to have a pleasant dinner and not have to deal with the noise level because the food is actually very good and is the saving grace of this restaurant."

The longest I waited was about 45 minutes, but in the meantime the guys from the bar entertained me and served me some alcohol drinks (not for free, of course). I am always surprised how many people already know about this little treasure place and willing to wait (like me) in the queue to be sited. The stuff are super friendly and welcoming which makes you want to come back there.. Whenever I go to Mildred’s, I usually share the food with the person(s) who comes with me, so then I can eat different dishes from the (very) diverse menu (Sharing is caring, don’t be snob and Joey does share food!); Although after so many times visiting there (and actually trying all the menu), I can spot my top 3 dishes.So here it is, my favorite dishes:1. Sunblushed tomato, mozzarella and basil risotto cake with wilted spinach, green beans and grape mustard cream sauce- £10.50 2. Sri Iankan sweet potato and cashew nut curry with yellow basmati rice with peas and coconut tomato sambal- £10.5Image3. Organic energising detox salad with beetroot, carrots, fennel, sprouting beans, sultanas, coriander and toasted seeds with apple, organge, lime, ginger dressing plus amazing goat cheese,plus goats cheese- £7.95I also tried and loved:* the fresh tortelloni filled with pumpkin and ricotta, with chestnut mushroom, white wine cream sauce, drizzled with truffle oil (you can take this one as starter as well) 6.5/10.5As for dessert, I am not going to show you a photo of it, because I don’t want you to drull on your keyboard, but I would totally recommend you to have chocolate peanut butter brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce which will give you the right sugar bomb that you need to end this amazing dinner you are having.Enjoy your amazing dinner!"

I am vegetarian and she likes healthy food, so a great choice for us.I chose the burger because it is such a relief to be able to order one, knowing the grill will be meat free too! It came with chips and relish and was delicious. Be warned not to have the mixed bread basket first with this, or you'll never get through it. The bread was also fantastic and tasted home made. My friend had soup of the day, which she thoroughly enjoyed.The service was good, but they were over stretched at lunchtime. I always wonder why staff are so thin on the ground in some busy places, as more attentive service always helps with extra courses/drinks and add-on's, I find. Easily pay for themselves.The tables are close together and there is quite basic furniture, so not really a romantic meeting place, but amazing food, a varied menu, and flies the veggie flag well. If you are a meat eater, go in and be amazed."

I didn't just want burger and chips though, I fancied something special and that's certainly what I got. The mushroom and ale pie blew my socks off! It was bloody lovely. The service is quick, the food was with us in 10 minutes I reckon. The tables are placed very close, don't expect a lot of privacy, if you want an intimate meal you might be better off going to Manna... However, for a bite with friends or a relaxed meal in company you probably won't be disappointed. I had mixed mushroom, porcini and ale pie with mushy peas and mash (£10.25). My partner opted for the burger and chips but it's not just a regular burger - the burger of the day came in a sourdough bun with relish, red onion, rocket and tomato, with fries and basil mayo (£9.10). We shared a big bottle of fizzy water and the bill was £25. They don't take reservations so you may have to wait at the bar with a drink for a table but I saw people drinking bellinis (£6.50) so not so bad I reckon if you have to wait..."

Their artichokes are lovely (really yum and best dish) and so is the burrito, also the fried dumplings were decent. Pasta looked a bit plain but nice nevertheless. Asian stir fry veg was disappointing and the sausage and mash horrible so please avoid! A meal for three with three cocktails, 2 starters and three mains (no dessert) cost us £77. Would I go here again - no.. the food didn't work for me although given that its so packed I am sure they are doing something right.The waitress who served us was lovely and I have no complaints on the service front.This is good for people who are vegan or have allergies as it caters to those who may dietary issues (including dairy free desserts i think)."

The service was quite frenetic and efficient, but I wouldnt call it friendly. The staff seem so busy that the human touch has been slightly overlooked. I want to go back and try everything on the menu though!My only real surprise was that the only milk on offer (with tea/coffee) was dairy and soya. Soya is really not healthy and most are moving towards rice and nut milks these days. A bit of rice milk would have earned 5 stars. Its the details which make all the difference."

That's fine (though does seem like a ploy to make the place look busier) but what annoyed me was that the waiter couldn't be bothered to hand me the drinks menu, instead he pointed it out across the room near the till for me to get which I found quite lazy. The waiter and barman were swearing to each other about something too which wasn't very professional. Thankfully the menu had good variety, the food was very tasty. It arrived quickly (table service was great) so we got to the theatre on time. Quite reasonably priced too.I'd go back again and hope for better service at the entrance."

They insisted in bringing us along. As soon as we entered they noticed differences with their previous visits: at the lower floor, just near the entrance, the tables had been removed to make space for a salad buffet. I certainly disliked that the male waiters were wearing sleeveless tops.. There was a lot of chaos, it is clear that the place got too tiny for the fame they acquired and there is no proper space where to wait for a table and you are squeezed in a tiny corridor where waitress pass by all the time doing a slalom to avoid you. Upstairs it is much better, not so noisy and crowded, it is sort of a private room. The food was very expensive and it is nothing wow, like it used to, as my parents pointed out. I ordered truffle tortellini only to find out and they had tomato sauce on top!. The waitress had communication problems and didn´t explain herself clearly regarding the dishes she brought to the table, so two of us ended up swapping their order. Luckily we do not have allergies! My parents were so disappointed and said that it was the last time they were there. No more Mildred´s. It has been too much in the press and in the media and they just lost the magic. Pity."

I used to think that it was all well and good but that it would be a whole lot tastier if there were a couple of sausages on the side. This place rips that whole idea to shreds though. For a place as busy as this is, it was virtually full by 12.30 on a Saturday having only opened at midday, and smack bang in the middle of Soho, it’s very reasonable. I had the burger of the day (there is always a burger of the day and a pasta of the day which are safe options for non-veggies) and it was called “Mock Duck” as it basically tasted like hoisin duck in a bun (great buns by the way – almost like a brioche). My other half (who is the driver of the veggie eating from both a health and environmental POV) and I shared the platter to start (hummus, falafels, etc). She enjoyed her superfood salad main course - all in all highly recommended."

Last week I decided I'd write a long-overdue review, but the night I chose proved to be a bit of nightmare for the restaurant's staff. Their electricity had packed up so: no lift. no tills, no hot drinks and only gas appliances in service. Nonetheless, the establishment remained open and the meeter-and-greeter met and greeted us with a warning of long waiting times for a table - an hour, and hour and a half... this wasn't because there weren't any tables free, but because the kitchen was struggling to cope.It's a mark of the loyalty of Mildred's customers that most of them sat and waited, despite the plethora of other options available in Soho. And when the food finally arrived my companion and I were rewarded with a Mushroom Ale pie with Chips and a Stir-fry that were just as delicious as ever. Probably more, because we were so hungry! Mildred's meals rock. That's why it's so busy, so popular and so awesome."

However, despite the reviews the food was no more than average with a conveyor belt feel and once again we experienced below average service including being served a 1/2 finished bottle of beer which was removed (on request) with little explanation. Perhaps a free drink next time? One of our party left early and their setting was cleared despite the rest of the party still being there. The automatic 12% service charge is - in my view - just a cheek because the service was poor - definitely felt they were doing us a favour - and the food did not begin to compensate."

What we didnt expect is that we'd have to wait in what is essentially a crowded corridor full of coats and people pushing past and you AREN'T ALLOWED TO LEAVE. They keep coming round to check that you're still there, otherwise they give your table away.Over an hour later (and full of rage), we finally get seated and then... nothing... No one comes to take our order for about 15 minutes. Eventually we get someone's attention and place an order. Despite having ordered starters, the main courses turn up about 60s later. We send them away and point out that we ordered starters, and they arrive soon too. About 20 minutes later, THE VERY SAME PLATES OF FOOD THAT WE WERE GIVEN 20 MINUTES AGO re-appear, cold. We point out that they must be having a laugh, and they bring us some new ones.The sad thing is that the food is actually good, but the whole experience is awful.

It was the first time I had been, and as a vegetarian I was keen to try it out. Some of the tables were very close together as the place is not very large but extremely popular. I had a lovely fresh salad, which although labelled a starter was a fine portion size for lunch. My friend recommended to try a dessert, and the pistachio polenta cake was divine. Although, it did take two requests to get a dessert menu and then another request to place a dessert order. We were not in a rush but this might have been irritating if we had been in a hurry. Service was not particularly attentive as we were also not asked if we would like any other drinks or if we would like anything else. But the atmosphere was nice, there were lots of yummy menu choices that spoiled me for choice, and the prices were not extreme for the heart of Soho. I gather it is easier to get a table at lunchtime than for dinner, and I would like to go back to try out more menu options. This could become a treat restaurant for me on special occasions."

Thank you Mildred's- for all of it. You guys rock- don't ever change!"

Hubbie ordered the mushroom and ale pie (which looked delish) and I ordered a burger. When it arrived, I discovered that the centre of my burger was almost stone cold. I told the server who apologised and took it back, leaving my husband's food on the table - therefore I assumed that the meal would be back very quickly, just heating the burger through properly. So I waited, and waited. And waited. My husband hates to eat alone so waited for mine to arrive. So his got cold. Mine eventually arrived (a whole new meal - if they were going to do this, they should have replaced both meals - we had gone there to eat a meal together, not separately!) So our lunch together was a real let down, money wasted and it rather spoiled our afternoon.Oh, but they still added on 12.5% service charge onto the bill, which was a bloody cheek!Much as I have loved this restaurant in the past, and have visited many times, I'm not sure I'd go back. There are plenty of other places to eat.Really, really disappointing :(Note: the burger was pretty tasty when it arrived, with chips, and the portion was huge."

The burrito (black beans, corn, pumpkin, rice, lashings of melted cheese) was sublime. Seriously, seriously good. Friends had aubergine & chickpea curry and burger of the day which was bean & peppers. Both were delicious. Only one of us managed dessert & it was of the same standard- word of advice, dessert portions are very generous. The only negatives are the no booking policy that blights Soho... Turning up at 6ish means a half hour wait, after that seemed unlikely to get seated before you feel the need to snack on a menu in desperation & it's pretty cramped waiting by the door. Linked to that is we had to share a table which was on the squashed side. Overall I will definitely be dining here again but will go super early or after 9"

Infrequent visitors to London, we first discovered Mildred's in 2010, and this year was only my second visit. It is halfway up a side street but easy walking distance from theatreland. I was very impressed with the food on both occasions. The first time I had a burrito which was stuffed with vegetables and had all the necessary sour cream, guacamole etc, followed by apple crumble. This time I had tagliatelle and peach tart. We just turned up on the off chance of getting in and found the staff very accommodating. I think we were squeezed into the last table, and people were knocking against the back of my seat as they were coming and going, but that was bearable when the food was so good.

I wandered past around 8pm expecting to find it quite quiet, but it wasn't, so I came back around 9pm, only to find it still very busy. However, they fitted me in very promptly in the bar area, took my order, and brought the food shortly afterwards. I chose one of the specials: chestnut & mushroom wellington with roasted root veg, savoy cabbage and facon in a red wine jus (£10.95), accompanied with a glass of Calor Tempranillo (£4.75). It was an excellent meal, and I speak as a non vegetarian, though an enthusiast for good veggie food. Service was very friendly, prompt, and professional and there was a real buzz in the restaurant. The service charge of 12.5% is added to the bill but is, of course, optional - service charge is evenly distributed between all staff. The restaurant itself is cosy and pleasant, and this area of Soho is accessible (not far from Piccadilly Circus) and full of character, but not overrun. There are plenty of other restaurants not far away, but this seems one of the most popular and I can see why. I hope to return soon."

I had been looking forward to taking my vegetarian friends to Mildred's as I have been twice before and enjoyed the food and atmosphere there. We arrived and were told that we could not be seated until all of our party was present. That was fine and to be expected in Soho on a busy Friday night. We were not invited to have a drink at the bar. While one of my friends was on the phone outside the restaurant, the host told us we could be seated and then when he realised we weren't all present said loudly, ""Where's the rest of your party? I've just turned another group away"". We told him that one person was on the phone arranging for the last person to get there to which he remarked impatiently, ""well are they here or not?"". We had been happy to wait at the bar but were given conflicting instructions and received very rude treatment. The other members of staff also appeared to be annoyed and confused by his behaviour. Unsurprisingly, we chose to leave. Had we been allowed to have wait at a table until the fourth person arrived we would have ultimately spent more on drinks and food. As it was, we didn't even get to order a drink at the bar.I'm very disappointed as, although I have enjoyed dining there before, I will not be returning.

We ordered four different meals and we all loved every one of them. The food was amazing, lovely food cooked meals that really filled us up. It was great for a cold November day.The restaurant is in Soho, close to Leicester Square and it very easy to find. There are lots of quirky shops around it too so you don't have to just find this place to have a great meal. The staff were really friendly and it was quite reasonably priced, especially for the standard and portion size of the food. I think the bill came to £51 for the meals and drinks which is great in London. I had the Sri Lankan curry and it was amazing.It has a wide range of meals from vegetarian, vegan, gluten and wheat free so this place should be able to cater for all tastes. You cannot reserve a table here so it is a bit of a scrum to get a seat, even at 12:00 when it opens and the restaurant is a little cramped with all the Saturday shopping bags. Don't let this put you off though, it is a great wee place and I would certainly recommend this to anyone in London."

Find it and eat here ! Trust me this is the place to go to. It is situated on Lexington St in Soho so it’s a bit off the main throughfare of oh so trendy bars etc. But it is worth the walk oh yes it is !! Basically you must get here by 5 (it opens at 5) to grab a table there is no real room to wait and queue and the queues do form quick to grab a place here. But the food is divine. We went for a raspberry soda + beer, Burger of the day and risotto for mains plus grilled halloumi the humus for starters. Dear god I could not stop eating. It was the food of the gods. Being a confirmed carnivore I was so shocked to be enjoying food of the fleshless variety - but trust me I am now a C*O*N*V*E*R*T. I only had two issues - the first was that the toilets are shared so I walked to find a female doing her lipstick at the sink to which automatically apologised before back tracking out. Only to realise that I hadn’t invaded her space but that she was in effect invading mine ! The second issue was that we did have to wave a bit to get the attention of the staff to reorder more beers. But to be frank that this was a very small price to pay for the glorious dining experience that is Mildreds. My advice is to go here quick before the Camden council raise the rates and price it out of business. Its simply amazing !"

Once there it is a treat for vegetarians, good food with a wide selection of dishes and a fun dynamic atmosphere, I had the mushroom and ale pie with chips, a lovely rich taste. Generous portions left no room for pudding but they looked very enticing. On a Saturday night the place was full, always a good sign. They do not take booking so you might have to wait a while but it is worth it . The prices very reasonable for London, we will definitely return."

We arrived at about 9pm and didn't have a reservation so waited about 30 minutes for a free table; the staff were happy to serve us drinks while we waited at one of the tables outside.Inside the tables are quite close together so be prepared to overhear (and be overheard!) but very well presented, The staff were courteous and friendly without being intrusive. The menu was varied, with a good number of options for each course. I never eat three courses nut could not choose between the starters and deserts so opted for all three - I was very full at the end but not disappointed. I had the artichoke crostini, then mushroom and ale pie, both of which were delicious and right sized portions. I cannot recommend the Cambridge burnt cream highly enough!! It was delicious, creamy and beautiful - I will absolutely be having that next time!All in all, a good veggie restaurant. Vegan options available."

Shame on you!!,"We were a group of 3 friends on an impromptu Friday night dinner date. Didn't have to queue - 'great', we thought, especially as they don't take reservations. Got shown to a table on the top floor. It was a small room with one of us having to sit backing on to the doorway and corridor where the waiters were busily coming back/forth with food. So, before sitting down, we politely asked for the next table along, which was exactly the same as ours in size and available. ""No"", she said firmly, ""that is for 6 people and you are three. It's not possible"". It wasn't reserved and there was no issue in letting us have it. The only thing she would have to do is remove the extra cutlery - there were no plates or anything. Anyway, she wasn't interested and kept insisting it was a table for 6.So as not to ruin the evening, we sat down at the allocated table. My friend was of course disturbed by the corridor, and so we asked if we could shift our table a couple of inches back, to give him that little bit of personal space you need without plates hovering over your head every 5 minutes. ""No"" she said, as it would be too close to the (invisible!!) people at the empty table referred to previously. We just said, ""look, we want him to be comfortable, we will move it back to the original place when the table of 4 (yes FOUR humans!!!) arrives"". No real issues with taking our food order. It was relatively efficient, although no service with a smile. The food was excellent, we ordered burrito, haloumi burger, and the curry. Highly recommend. After 30 mins of being there people finally arrived to the empty table. They sat down, all was fine. Then she asked us, whilst we were in mid eating mode to move our table back to the original spot (like 2 inches the other way) and stood over us until we did it. Again, we tried to continue on the good vibe (having not seen each other in months!) and ignored her rude behaviour. After our desserts, we ordered 2 English breakfast teas, and one green tea. She came back with the order the wrong way round and basically created a scene with my friends and rudely told them they didn't order 2 EB teas and stormed off. The final straw was at billing time. We had agreed that service from the lady was very rude and that the ""discretionary"" 12.5/13% that had been added was inappropriate. We split the amount (excl. service) three ways. She says ""you haven't paid enough"". I said ""we have paid correctly - for everything except your service which we are not happy with on a number of levels"". There was no acknowledgement, no sorry, and no goodbye. Bad food I can tolerate as mistakes can happen. Bad service on the other hand, is what annoys me the most. Her dramatical explosions on each occasion were tolerated as we didn't want to spoil our moods on this reunion, but she made it memorable for all the wrong reasons. Thanks for nothing... who thought vegetarians could be so cruel ey?"

Cocky, arrogant man organising tables who has an attitude of “if you don’t like it, go somewhere else, we don’t need your business”. Were not made to feel welcome or special at any point in the evening. Nicely decorated but the staff ruin the atmosphere with their cold attitude. £20 for a vegetarian main and a drink, not sure how that can be justified.

Disappointingly Mildred's didn't live up to it. We had dinner in the bar area which was nice, lovely to see the quirky passers by. Service was fine, no complaints about the staff or waiting time. The food though was nothing special. We both found the portion sizes were on the mean side and the dishes overcomplicated, i.e. lots of ingredients but the end result was nothing special. We ordered the burger of the day upon the waitress' recommendation but were underwhelmed with the stodginess and greasiness of the patty. We skipped dessert as the area where we were sitting was getting uncomfortably crumped with customers waiting for tables.Overall neither of us felt the experience was worth repeating."

Everything is clearly marked and staff are very helpful.It looks small from outside and there are generally a lot of people outside drinking and talking. Inside, the building goes back along way and there is seating along the walls near the bar as well as normal tables further back in the main restaurant. I would definitely eat here even if you are not veggie. The atmosphere is that of a very popular modern London restaurant and not everyones perception of a veggie eating place.There is a bar near the entrance and you can just have a drink here. The cocktails are good and the wine reasonably priced.Like most places these days, there are no reservations allowed.You are met by a guy with an ipad who advises you a wait time and takes your name. He will then let you know when a table is ready. Two things here –1) please wait….it’s worth it!! 2) Don’t be put off by the waiting time he gives you. They are on top of the situation and sort people out very quickly. You may only have a problem if in a large group. We were told an hour and fifteen minutes and were still drinking our first drink when we got seated.The food is simply outstanding. The presentation is top notch and the staff are knowledgeable about what they are serving. I had roasted halloumi to start followed by asian stir fried vegetables. Both options may sound a little bland but believe me, they tatsed amazing! My dessert was a gluten free Persian lemon and pistachio polenta cake with yoghurt and a rose petal and pomegranate syrup. The flavours were fantastic. The protion sizes were very good and I was absolutely stuffed! My daughter had a chocolate and nut brownie with vegan ice cream. It also happened to be gluten free so I tasted it.You would never think it was vegan. The flavours were strong and sweet. Totally delicious. Dinner came to £70 for 3 courses, 2 cocktails and 2 glasses of wine.Not bad for a soho location and exceptional food."

It's your 30th and you can't book a table at your favourite place for 9 of your friends. We're happy to wait the 60-90 minutes we were told it would take for a table. The guy organising the seating said we should have arrived early, not 'Spanish early' at 7:30. Fair enough if slightly stereotypical. We were not allowed to leave if we wanted to keep the table. Even leaving a card or phone number would be a good option seeing as the John snow pub is 20m away.. The drinks here are overpriced and limited and there is no room to stay and drink them except for on the street. We went to get a drink and found a space at the bar. I was in the way of a waitress clearing an area. No politeness whatsoever when asking me to move. Waited 10 minutes for an acknowledgement from the bar staff: nothing. Realised there was a queue but nobody thought to mention it to us. Decided to get a drink from the john snow and stand on the street with our friends. Considering our wait was over 90 minutes in the end, I think it was acceptable to get our drinks from the cheaper of the two seeing as we would be spending a lot of money in Mildred's. The guy mentioned above said that 'they are a successful restaurant and it wasn't fair that we get drinks from elsewhere'. At that point I decided Mildred's would not receive any of my money. I left and I hope my friends feel grateful for the seats they may now have been allowed to sit in. To ask us to wait on the street for 90 minutes before eating there and expecting us to only spend our money there is laughable especially with the snootiness of the staff. A victim of its own success that makes you feel that you are lucky to be seated. Good luck with that attitude. I won't be visiting again and will not be recommending Mildred's to anyone."

As a treat for my wife we went to Mildreds last night and were very impressed. My wife had the soup followed by a Meze and I had Hummous and smoky red pepper babaganoush with chargrilled flat bread as my starter followed by Sri Lankan sweet potato and cashew nut curry. The only mild complaint was that the Hummous in my wife's Meze was a little over Chillied for her taste so I ate it instead. I didn't missed the meat at all and thought the Sri Lankan Curry amazing. We had as much free tap water as we required as I had to drive and the bill was laughably small for a London restaurant. Well done to all the staff, front of house and Kitchen. All carnivores must give Mildreds a visit to sample the other side of foods vast spectrum of tastes."

Yesterday was our second visit to Mildred's, which I would call a cafe, rather than a restaurant. On both occasions we were blown away by how unfriendly the staff were. Yesterday the young lady in front couldn't even bother to walk us to a table, instead gesturing towards the back for us to make our own way there, only to be left standing there as two other members of staff did pretty much the same thing.  The guy who took our order, was the first and only person during both visits who a actually made us feel welcome. The other two yesterday, were just robots. My partner ordered a burger, with sweet potato fries, and I had sweet potato and broad bean curry. Our food arrived shortly after our drinks, which was surprising. Was it cooked to order, or simply microwaved? If only, both our meals were cold and the sweet potato fries, had clearly been cooked much earlier. The guy who served our meals was as cold as the food. Our food was taken back, and re-appeared, this time piping hot. The food on both occasions have been average, no more. Presentation scores 2 out of 10. I was rather surprised that on receiving our bill, no one had really offered an apology, or even a coffee on the house. On leaving I mentioned it to the one lady who had served our drinks. She offered to call the manager but as we were in a hurry, she asked for my email address. She whipped a pen out that was wedged in her hair for me to use. Nice touch I thought. It's now been a day later and I've not heard from the manager. Perhaps we've been spoilt by the vegetarian restaurants in Brighton, as Terre a Terre is our benchmark of what veggie food can taste and look like. My advice, get on a train to Brighton and eat at Terre a Terre. Even AA Gill rates it very highly."

We went before a night at the theatre and my friends got their early (5.00pm) as you are unable to reserve a table and the restaurant is quite small so there can be a long queue for a table.The restaurant itself is more casual dining than fine dining and perfect before a show. The waiting staff were very helpful and although they did mess up slightly with one of the starters they did resolve the situation (you can't ask for more as we are all human). The food was hot and plentiful and very filling, I wanted dessert but even if we had had the time I don't think I could have managed it after a very filling butternut squash curry (recommended).I would happily eat here again and recommend it to veggies and non veggies alike, it is nice to see my friend struggle to choose something rather than having to have the token veggie option provided.

The menu is varied, the dishes are fresh and full of flavour and the prices are very reasonable (around £10 for a hearty main). The ambience is unpretentious and friendly, but the lovely light space and classy decor is stylish enough for a ""proper"" dinner date. Admittedly, it is intimate and clearly very popular so the inability to make a reservation might be problematic - however, we arrived at 6.30pm on an August bank holiday (Soho was buzzing with crowds) and were seated immediately and served quickly, which made it the perfect option for a pre-theatre dinner.

It's a great option for private dining - the minimum spend is reasonable and you get a nice room all to yourselves! The majority of our party were not vegetarian, but we all really enjoyed the food. If I could cook like this, I would probably be able to be vegetarian! The private dining room used to be at the front, but they have (probably sensibly) turned that into more regular dining space. However, the room at the back is more than adequate and comes with a dock so you can play your own music. As it's quite a cosy place, you still soak up the atmosphere from the rest of the restaurant. Only downside is that you can't book a table (except for private dining)."

We have tried to get in three times before but there was always a massive queue so we just gave up. It was worth taking another chance as when we got there about 6pm there were plenty of tables available. By the time we left about 8pm all the tables were taken and the bar area was rammed with people waiting to dine (they do not take bookings here). It is no wonder people were queuing as the menu is great - a really wide variety of veggie food to choose from. We ordered the halloumi and artichoke to start, followed by the mushroom pie, and burrito for mains, and a brownie and peach tart for dessert. Our plates were clean - all dishes were absolutely delicious. The service was very friendly and ultra efficient - our wine was topped up a bit too much for our liking! The decor is more of a cafe style and the major annoyance here is how closely they ram the customers in. There really is barely any space between the tables - I was pleased we got there early as we had a bit of privacy until the dessert. However the gorgeous food more than made up for it so I will definitely visit again."

Enjoyed a drink at the bar with a crowd of other London hopefuls as we waited for a table (Mildred's don't take bookings). After being offered a quicker seat if we were happy to share with two others (which we were) we were seated and out order taken promptly. The crowd at Mildred's is certainly diverse and interesting - it seems that everyone from locals, to young intellectuals, to the London art scene (and everyone in-between) have discovered this not-so-well kept secret. The vibe was jumping. There was so much choice on the menu that it was hard to decide, but eventually I chose a gourmet version of a veggie burger and my friend had a mushroom pie - both were to die for...this is one place I will always be visiting when I'm London!"

We arrived about 5:30 and there was no problem getting a table for 4. When we left at about 6:15 it appeared to be much busier with only few small tables available.The staff were very friendly, though they could have communicated a little better. My only real gripe with the staff is their lack of communication in letting you know what is happening. We ordered drinks and whilst two arrived swiftly, the second two did not arrive until after our food had arrived and by that time my daughter wanted drink number two. It appeared there was an issue with the juicer! The food arrived and was great - though again one of the sides was delayed - we thought we had been forgotten. A little communication would have helped alleviate our worries.We had 4 different main courses and every one was excellent. Portion sizes were generous. The fresh juice was lovely and you get to choose your own mix. Apple with ginger and lime is lovely!Be aware that the Service Charge is already included in the bill at 12.5%. I do not like it to be automatic, but I am aware that many restaurants do include it now.All in all a great meal was had by all 4 of us in a restaurant with a nice feel to it.

They cater exceptionally well for both. My friend warned me that they didn't take bookings and that we would have to just hope it wasn't too packed. ""How busy can it be on a tuesday?"" I said.... Very busy apparently. We arrived at 6:30pm and could barely fit in the door. Once we had squeezed in (the bar is at the front and the restaurant at the back) we were greeted almost instantly by a friendly and helpful waiter. He explained that there was around a 25 minute wait for a table. My friend was all for trying somewhere else as she was hungry and pushed for time but the waiter suggested that we take a look at the menu, order when we were ready and that way the food would come quicker once we were seated. What a good idea! This meant we could have a drink at the bar and cut down on the waiting time for our food. They have iPads which create a tab for you under your name and appear to be linked to both the kitchen and the bar so he put in our order for food and created a table reservation for us. Meanwhile we shuffled over to the bar.... As it was so packed the bar was a hive of activity with the two barstaff not only serving those standing at the bar but also making up the drinks orders for the restaurant. However, we were again served promptly by a friendly barman. We ordered two cocktails, a Porn Star Martini and an Elderflower Martini. Martinis are one of my favourites and the Elderflower one is one of the best I've had. Smooth, cold, refreshing and not overpowering on the elderflower. All we had to do was to mention our name and the drinks were added onto our tab, again through an iPad behind the bar. Not sure why but it makes me feel a little more VIP than giving a number!We had barely had a few sips of our cocktails (maybe we were chatting too much) when the waiter came to find us to tell us our table was ready. He pointed us in the direction of the back where a table in the corner was set up and had our main courses already waiting for us. It is this level of service that really impressed me and made me like Mildred's before we had even eaten. A woman at the table next to us even commented that it was such good service to have our food there when we arrived!The food itself was delicious and in huge portions. I had the detox salad with goats cheese which comprised of a whole manner of wonderful ingredients coming together superbly. My friend had the risotto which came as something looking like a burger but was a risotto cake, crispy on the outside and meltingly gooey in the middle. For pudding we both had an amazing chocolate and peanut butter brownie (gluten free). It came in a lake of warm chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream which melted over the hot brownie. Worth every bite! This again, was delivered promptly after our mains as if it had been waiting in the wings for it's grand entrance at just the right time. Two drinks, main courses and desserts came to £51 which, for that area of London and the amazing standard of both food and service, is very reasonable. It is a buzzing little place, somewhere would go with friends rather than for a romantic dinner or a quiet bite to eat. Certainly it isn't somewhere I can imagine lingering over a coffee as it appears to be quite fast paced. However if you are looking for a place to catch up with a friend who needs to be somewhere else by a certain time, then it is worth a try!"

All the menu options had additional information such vegan, gluten free, wheat free and also if these were options available for the dish. All the dishes were imaginative and provided a whistle stop tour around the world... from Burgers, Italian, Middle easten to Asian, choice is amazing.Our food was wonderfully cooked and presented, my son had the Borrito which he said had a good kick to it, my husband Sri Iankan sweet potato and cashew nut curry was nicely flavoured, my daughter had the Pasta special which she said was great and I had the Sunblushed tomato, mozzarella and basil risotto cake, the dressing was unusally flavoured, but it complimented the risotto cake.Desserts...... well that was just as difficult choose, but again beatifully made and presented.I did like the fact that tap water was available and we were not expected to order expensive mineral water. The service was efficient, and the atmosphere was buzzing but not too loud as to make chatting diffiuclt. We also thought it was great Value for money.

Lovely food even if you're not a veggie.There was a group of us celebrating a birthday, and we were all very happy with our meals and the service. My starter of Roman style artichoke was far better than any carciofo alla Romana I've eaten in Rome! Followed by chick pea & cauliflower tagine with prune cous cous; others had equally tasty and imaginative dishes.We were seated in the upstairs front room,which was pretty, and quieter than downstairs. There's also a room where I've had a private dinner with a group, but min spend £250 if you want to reserve this.Starters £5 - £7, mains £8 - £11 (approx).I suppose because they're so popular they can call the shots - you can't reserve, and you all have to be there to be seated. So if one of your party is 10 minutes late you all have to stand round and wait. This doesn't feel friendly, but I guess it means that Mildred's maximises its throughput of diners."

Also our table was next to a tall slim shelving unit where they kept the utensils, napkins, glasses etc. which meant the waitressing staff were continually coming through between tables to collect things when setting up tables etc. This in itself is disrupting when eating your meal. When pointing this out to the waiter he said that it is a problem as previous visitors had mentioned this but obviously this has not been dealt with by the owners.It has not put me off going again though, perhaps a different time of day I would choose."

We were expecting a bit of a wait but were escorted to a table within 10 minutes. The menu looked good. We had the chickpea curry and Mushroom Pie. The portion sizes were good (sometimes vegetarian options come up rather small and often uninspiring and this definitely wasn't the case with Mildred's). The staff were friendly, knew the menu and were experienced and speedy. The food was hot, tasty and thoroughly enjoyable. There was a great atmostphere - people coming back from shopping, those about to go out for the evening and some that looked llike this was their evening. Young and older. A real hotch potch of people who obviously all appreciated good vegetarian food, well cooked. A must if you are a vegetarian and damned good even if you aren't - like me, you'll find plenty to tempt you."

I heard enthusiastic comments about it so, in my mind, it was a sure shot.I was wrong, very wrong.I had a dish of curry with rice and some sweet potatoes, my friend had the meze mix.Starting from my dish: the potato chunks were ok but the curry was absolutely tasteless, watery and runny, the rice clearly microwaved (cold outside, piping hot inside, not many doubts about it) and the overall presentation quite poor.But my friend had the best surprise: the dish looked visually ok, nothing outstanding a bit pricey for a meze mix but still reasonable. The only thing is that he found a massive hair that looked like a chunky human hair but turned out to be a brush hair. The waiter apologized and called the manager who came explaining that the hair was coming from a brush and my friend has been offered to order something else for free and that the dish would have not been charged. He ordered a side side dish because he had lost his appetite in the meantime.But when the bill came, another surprise. They still charged the dish on the bill, they charged the service and no-one said even goodbye on out way out.Mistake happens, they shouldn't if you have such a reputation, but there are many ways to handle them.But more than the hair, more than the bill, more than the service, there are no excuse for microwaved rice. I can have at home all the times I want."

The place was hiving and very loud (as I noticed others have mentioned before in their reviews). I had to wait about 10 minutes for my table but this was understandable given that it lunchtime and there dining area is pretty small. I was given the menu whilst I waited and given regular updates on when I could expect my table to be ready.The problem with the menu is that there is just too much choice! I'm used to scanning menus for the 'V' beside dishes I can eat so it was quite a task to narrow down the entire menu to one selection. In the end I went for the Sri Lankan sweet potato and cashew nut curry, and certainly wasn't diasppointed! It was really tasty and super fresh.The staff in Mildred's were clearly rushed off their feet but were really friendly and helpful and I never felt under pressure or uncomfortable.Next time I'm in London I will definitely be heading back to Mildred's, and hopefully with some carnivorous friends so that they can see what they're missing!"

There are no soft furnishings and the restaurant is like a narrow rectangular box. I don't know how the waiting staff cope with it. I found the noise actually painful. A pity when it's not always easy to find dedicated vegetarian cooking.

The experience was truly worth the wait, from the great selection of starters, to the delicious burger of the day and finally the peanut butter chocolate brownie, which as other reviewers have commented is 'to die for'. The atmosphere is friendly and informal, great for a casual Friday night dinner. On our second visit we ordered exactly the same as the first and enjoyed it just as much! Equally good to visit just for the dessert, even with non-vegan friends. This will certainly not be our last visit."

Food is always delicious, staff is always friendly and attentive and what you get is good value for money. Highly recommend regardless weather you are vegetarian or not."

In particular, one about the chocolate and peanut butter brownie which sounded divine and I wanted to try.We went to Mildred's on a Wednesday evening at about 6 and although it wasn't full, it was really busy. We both opted for the mushroom, porcini and ale pie. It came served with lovely chunky chips and mushy peas. It was fantastic, perfectly cooked and the flavour was really intense. For dessert, it had to be the brownie which was served with chocolate sauce and ice cream. It was everything I expected it to be. It was served warm and had a really rich flavour, but not so rich I couldn't finish it. The service was efficient and the prices were reasonable for central London. I would recommend visiting Mildred's and will no doubt be returning again one day very soon."

Her sister and I both are meat eaters and all three of us loved the food. The Vegan member of the party was thrilled as she had so much choice and she could not believe the dessert that we had - The Peanut Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream. Mind you I was pretty blown away by it as well. We had one for the three of us and it was plenty! The mains were 2 Asian vegetable stir fry and a Tagine - all were amazing. I will definitely be visiting again. My only complaints were the service was a bit slow for ordering the dessert and it would have been better if the dessert was smaller and less expensive.

Mildred's is perfectly positioned between the two. Its very informal without being at all scruffy, and offers a wide variety of reasonably priced vegan and vegetarian food- you could go for three courses, or just a light snack. We went for a late lunch, and sat in the window looking out onto the street in the afternoon sunshine. The fantastic array of dishes on offer made it difficult to choose, and being slightly hungover I opted for the veggie burger of the day. It was probably one of the best burgers I have ever eaten- massively flavoursome, just the right amount of heat and loaded with Monterey Jack cheese, fresh onions and tomatoes. The basil mayonaise that accompanied it along with the crispy potato wedges was perfection. If I lived nearby I would go back until I had tried everything on the menu! It makes me very happy that this kind of entirely vegetarian/vegan restaurant exists at all, as it doesn't seem that long ago that I was in Burger King with my teenage mates requesting 'a burger without the burger in' just so I could eat with everyone else! Okay its 20 years ago, but you get the point. Looking forward to returning one day :-)"

They were very accommodating though and we ordered some drinks from the bar and managed to ""perch"" (expecting to moved on at any minute) on a couple of stools to the side. Waited about half an hour for a table - not too bad with a drink in hand. Food was very good - as a veggie I am always confused by the amount of choice on offer to me at vegetarian restaurants as I am used to normally having one not very appetising option elsewhere, and Mildred delivers plenty of appetising options! We decided to share starters as there were too many we wanted to try - I thought the artichoke crostini and gyoza dumplings were delicious. I had the mezze plate for a main - very nice. My boyfriend, who is not vegetarian, very much enjoyed the mixed mushroom pie. Everyone enjoyed their food and the wine (recommended by the bar man) was very enjoyable too. It wasn't a cheap meal - but then we had plenty of drinks and plenty of food so no complaints there really. These are the sort of options that all restaurants should offer - not just dishes that are a cop out vegetarian option, but stuff that even meat eaters find appetising!"

They don't take any reservations but we sat outside and had a drink while we waited and were suited before the estimated time by a very efficient man with an iPad. There is limited room at the bar so we were lucky to get a warm evening to sit out the front. We had the halloumi and hummus/pitas to share for starter, followed by the stir fried asian veggies with tofu. I usually don't have tofu but was pleasantly surprised and my meal was certainly filling. Also tried some of the burrito, also delicious. For anyone who thinks vegetarian food is bland and not filling, I dare you to go to Mildred's and prove yourself wrong. Lively atmosphere and friendly service."

I'm a carnivore but enjoyed the selection - there is a lot of choice and variety. The one area that I feel lets it down is their no-reservation policy - you often have a long wait for a table and aren't able to come in to put your name down and get a drink somewhere else. Instead you have to drink at their bar which is essentially just a very busy corridor stuffed full of other people waiting for tables, with staff and customers pushing past you - not condusive to a relaxing start to your meal! We had to wait 15 mins at the bar for the bar staff to stop doing drinks orders for the restaurant and then they served someone who had just arrived rather than us. Once we got in the restaurant (which is a bit cramped) the service was a lot better. I think if they keep the existing policy they should look to expand or relocate the bar to somewhere people can actually enjoy a drink whilst they're waiting for their table. It's so busy I'm sure they'd fill a bigger premises."

As everything is so tasty I enjoy sharing a few dishes with whoever I go with - usually a couple of starters, one main and a side or desert will do for two people as the portions are perfect.I specially love the artichoke starter and the gyoza dumplings. I've taken a meat eaters to Mildred's on a number of occasions and they're always very impressed."

Its vegetarian/vegan menu is likely to please vegetarians/vegans and meat-eaters alike, with generous helpings of interesting dishes, made from organic and locally-sourced ingredients where possible. When we arrived at around 6pm, downstairs was packed - they don't take bookings - and we were given a 20-minute waiting time and were invited to order drinks at the bar while we waited (but couldn't get near it!). As it transpired, we were seated after about five minutes, by a window in the empty upstairs room! The starters were promising - gyoza dumplings, artichoke crostini, polenta, all very good. Our main dishes were a hefty mushroom & ale pie, spicy burrito, and tofu sausages. I think I drew the short straw with the sausages, as they were rather stodgy and tasteless, on a bed of slushy mash and overcooked kale, with an over-sweet pear cider jus. At £31.40 the biodynamic Macon Villages was disappointing. Very good service. I think I'll go with a halloumi burger next time!"

The food was superb, cannot fault it at all. I am very much a meat eater, but this place impressed me. To start I had halloumi, then a risotto cake. Both were very tasty and good value for money. The wine was really nice as was the prosecco. The service was good, if a little slow. Upon ordering prosecco I had to explain to the waiter the difference between cava and prosecco and show him that there was prosecoc on the menu, then when after giving us the dessert menu it was an hour before he came back to take our order, at which point it was 11pm and we decided to give it a miss. I think because we were in a private room the waiting staff were probably not as attentive as they would be if we were in the main restaurant. That said, the private dining room was lovely, made the evening nice and special and they allowed us to put up balloons etc. Overall loved it, I will be taking my meat eating husband there in the near future!"

I have to say that I'm used to a bit more space at Terre a Terre in Brighton, but I suppose space is not cheap in London so the restaurant is long and slim and a little cosy but the food is great, lots of options and flavours to try even if you are a seasoned veggie who thinks they can't possibly try anything new. Great for those non-veggies too as the portions are a good size but offer a range of textures and flavours to entice anyone. We were sat right at the far end of the long room and we certainly got there at the right time- 5pm on a Saturday. Half an hour later it was rammed with a queue. I noticed that whilst the staff did a great job they were constantly on their feet and tending to diners.The only thing that I wasn't impressed with really was the bar, selection of drinks and service from the bar.

Not being a vegetarian myself I was somewhat hesitant about going but decided to give it a whirl. The quality of the food is excellent, with freshly cooked large portions. I found the menu a little limited but then I am a meat eater and it wasn't designed for me! I am sure if you are a vegetarian, you will really enjoy Mildreds but get there early as it was packed at 5.45, with a queue out the door by the time we left at 7.00. Be warned though, it isn't cheap. I felt it was a little overpriced so special occasions only I would say."

It was so delicious I really need to go back soon and have a another piece!Other points to make - the menu is now much more suited to vegans as well as vegetarians.

Having said that they seated us much quicker than they originally told us we would have to wait (less than 10 minute as opposed to 45 minutes). Had the soup of the day which was spiced carrot, sweet potato and coconut milk, smoked tofu and apple sausages and then vegan banoffee pie. Soup was good and sausages with sides were tasty, but banoffee pie was a miss. Sister had dumplings to start which she said were great, curry, which had too much rice and not enough curry sauce making it dry, and fruit crumble for desert which she said was delicious. I'd go again but I'm not in a rush to do so."

We did the opposite to the last review and arrived late for lunch. It was still busy and lively but thinning out a bit and we got a table straight away. I'd prefer to be eating fish any day but I'll happily go back to Mildred's. Both the hummous and babaganoush and the chargrilled artichokes were excellent. For mains we had the sri lankan curry and the mixed meze and they were both great too. The violet colour of the beetroot part of the meze is interesting! I prefer puddings to be around £5 and nearly all of theirs are over £6, but the panettone bread and butter pudding was plenty to share between the two of us and the friendly staff were happy to provide two spoons.This is not a place for a romantic meal for two. It's plastic topped tables jammed close together, and busy, friendly and fairly noisy. But go for the food."

It was gorgeous and gobbed up in no time at all. I'm seriously thinking how I can make my own.My friend had the risotto cake and we shared the chocolate and raspberry truffle, which was a chunky slice of heaven and not as rich as you'd expect.Yes, you can't book and yes, it's very small so you're close to other diners. We shared a table and the first couple were fine but the second smooching all over each other was a bit cringey. However it didn't affect our experience; more gave us a laugh.We shared a bottle of organic white wine - and after being accidentally served a bottle of red, this was changed without full although we did have a bit of a wait (and a wait to order). But it was busy and it's Christmas so really no big deal.Would very much recommend to veggies and meat lovers. The sweet potatoe fries are also amazing as are the veggie burgers and burrito."

Each year instead of buying each other Christmas presents we go to London for a slap up meal. My wife is always happy to let me choose chose the restaurant, and pay! When I ask her what food she wants the reply is always replies the same “Anything, I’m sure I’ll find something on the menu I’ll like”. This year I thought I’d choose a vegetarian restaurant so our roles would be reversed and it was me left looking for something on the menu I’d like. Our first impressions was that it was that Mildreds is a single room retro-chic (think 1980’s habitat) café rather than restaurant. But the staff were friendly enough and settled us in without fuss. I started with the warm beetroot salad which was served with baby leaves, balsamic, hazelnuts and feta cheese. It was excellent. Then I moved on to the burger of the day which was a substantial affair, spicy, filling and very tasty. I chose the chips served with ketchup with chipotle. Stunning. My wife chose hummous and babaganoush with chilli oil and chargrilled flat bread, followed by buffalo mozzarella, green pea, basil, mint and saffron risotto cake served with chargrilled pepper and courgette and creamy red pepper sauce. It merited a WOW, from my wife. We were both really tempted by the desert menu but neither of us had room. The bill, including a glass of white peach Bellini each came to less than £50 including the 12.5% service charge. So great food, great value, great service. The last three years have seen us clock up six Michelin stars. The excellent food has been excellent albeit at a cost of more than £100 a head. But honestly, I don’t think we’ve had a more relaxed, enjoyable, or downright satisfying meal. It’s almost enough to turn me veggie. Almost!"

The menu has old favourites like mushroom and ale pie and there are daily specials that ensure variety for regular visitors.Meat eaters will find a lot to enjoy on the menu and it has a great range of choices for vegans and those needing gluten free foods. Service is friendly and cheerful though can be slightly chaotic at busier times. They are very helpful and even found a space for my folding bike to sit in safety. Some points to note are that they don't take reservations - at busier times you will have your name added to a list and be invited to stand in the entrance bar area until a table becomes free. It's a quick moving restaurant so you won't normally wait more than 10-15 minutes and you can start a bottle of wine while you wait. To avoid the wait, get there early, arriving at around 6.30 should see you seated immediately.You will be seated quite close to other diners, though there are no shared tables."

It's good to know that this place is maintaining its previous standards, serving up some of the best vegetarian food we've ever eaten. There are also plenty of vegan options available across a widely varied and very imaginative menu.This is one of those rare places where everything on the menu (including an array of daily specials) sounds tempting, served in large portions and packed with strong flavours. The burrito and pasta dishes come highly recommended, and the bread basket is also delightful, with a wide variety of drinks available from lagers to exotic fruit juices.Although we've given Mildred's five stars, we would like to raise two cautionary points. Firstly, it's expensive, and there's a 12.5 per cent service charge on top. Secondly, the restaurant is a victim of its own success, in that the limited number of tables fill up very quickly, leaving people queuing at the door for some time, and staff rushing around trying to keep up with everything. As long as you don't mind sitting quite close to your fellow diners, it's worth the wait, though. The food here really is exemplary."

Two of us were vegan and the other two meat eaters but they too were happy to be seduced by the comprehensive meat free menu. We all had different starters and different mains and not one of us had a word of criticism. Quite simply the food here is amazing. It's not a plush place by any means and for me, a bit of a cosmetic makeover seems long over- due. I can't help but feel that the whole experience might have been even more enjoyable if the surroundings had been just a tad more up-market. And if visiting with small children you may need to distract them from some of the photographs on the walls - well it is in Soho! But even the tired and worn surroundings could not detract from the fab food which I think is probably the best vegan food I have ever tasted. If you are vegetarian or vegan it's a real treat to have a menu that you can take ages in deciding what to pick from - rather than just one or two token veggie options. Highly recommended."

There are no reservations, so you arrive, and wait for a table to become available. We happily shared a table, but you could wait for whatever suits you. The food was excellent in terms of quality and quantity - vegetarian (of course), but beautifully prepared and of very high quality. The house red is also excellent value and quality. The service we found to be excellent - informal but very friendly and very efficient. In terms of restaurants in London this is not fine dining - the room is full, quite cramped and quite noisy. But our experience was very very positive, and if you like vegetarian food, this is the place! Strongly recommended."

For £6.50 it is great value given the top quality and taste. I've successfully managed to convert my non-veggie collegues at work into fans too - they love the burger as much as I do! The fries are nice and chunky and taste great too.I also sit and eat at Mildreds ocassionally. The ambience is normally good, but it does get a crowded at peak times. I normally go for the rissotto cake or mushroom pie, but the pasta dishes are good too if you don't want something as filling.Starters (halloumi is good) and desserts are worth trying too if you have a big appetite or are having a light main."

I left as did my companion, disappointed. Vegetarian cuisine has come on in leaps and bounds over the last few years and this place needs to up its game. It was more of an over populated cafe, with basic to middling veggie fair that can be found waving a tattered veggie flag on many a tired menu across the land. Hummus starter, butternut squash soup, veggie burger etc. I had the ravioli that kept a watery tomato sauce company. Boo. The butternut squash soup that my friend had tasted like a Jamie Oliver special but without the special. Even our waitress for the evening had a face of thunder that could curdle milk. I would bet money that the chef was not a vegetarian which is fine and unless you are a recent grad or a die-hard vegan that has long since lost the use of taste with fear of generalising, I cant see a reason to go back. Boo boo and thrice boo. The restaurant manager was a joy though and was the only one who seemed to be offering anything other than the bear minimum required."

Our party of 4 had a 1 hour wait and it was well worth it!! You can grab a drink and sit outside and watch the world go by. They will run a tab for you once you make a reservation. Our group started with the hummous and babaganoush, and a stuffed pepper (daily special). Excellent!!

It ended up being a very good choice - both the a la carte and specials menus are quite extensive, with many different options to appeal to all tastes. The portions are big, which is a big plus in London, in addition to good wine and dessert lists. The service was a little slow - we got there early, when there were only a few people dining, but still had to wait to order. We then had to wait again to get our bill and pay when it was busier. It doesn't take reservations, so you have to get there early. But overall a fresh, inventive take on vegetarian cuisine, in a good location (only a couple of blocks from Oxford St, and would be a great pre-dinner option for those going to the theatre)."

I've tried the red fruit crumble once but I did not like the cinnamon on top of it, I thought it ruined the whole pudding. My husband had the pistachio pudding and said it was nice.

The location is a few minutes walk from all the tourist attractions in London's West End. We arrived in the middle of lunchtime and the place was packed but they very quickly found us a table. The menu is reasonably extensive with unusual and clearly well thought out dishes. The portions were generous and the food was delicious. As for the desserts ... well there goes months of dieting. The chocolate rasberry truffle one could die for. The fruit crumble with custard was outstanding too.Service was efficient and very friendly and helpful. This place isn't cheap - a full meal with coffee and dessert cost nearly 50 pounds including service but it is worth every penny. Fantastic food.

Packed with Londoners and tourists, the wait for a table can be a while, but the food is creative, thoughtful, and delicious. We had the panfried cherry tomato, halloumi and wilted spinach salad dressed with balsamic, which was amazing. The frying brought out the sweetness of the tomato, the saltiness of the halloumi, and the balsamic was a perfect topping for this starter, creamy and thick while smoky and sweet. The buffalo mozzarella risotto cake featured layers of flavors from the peas, mint, basil, grilled peppers, and just enough sauce. Regrettably, there was no room for dessert.

Service was fantastic, price pretty reasonable too. The seating arrangement is ""communal"" for want of a better word, but not so much that privacy is an issue. We ordered the gyoza dumplings with miri and soy sauce dip and the fried haloumi and confite of cherry tomatoes in a balsamic dressing. Both were great. My main was the Sri Lankan sweet potato and cashew nut curry served with yellow basmati rice with peas and tomato sambal, my partner the haloumi burger.Both portions were generous. The curry was mild and fully flavoured, the sweet potato melting in the mouth, almost like a creamy mash, offset wonderfully with the mild crunch of the cashews. The mild spice of the curry was intensified by the spicy sambal. The rice was perfectly cooked with a heavy hint of anise and cardamom.My partner loved her burger.We're returning to London shortly and plan on eating there again."

It was a very busy Tuesday evening but having been told it would be a 30 mins wait, we actually got seated nearer to 15 mins. Brill menu, spoilt for choice. A great balance between classic and innovative dishes for both starters and mains plus specials. Sweet potato and cashew curry was lovely (though would have like more cashews in it - but that's just my preference!) and I reckon everything on the menu was good, which is why I'm going to have to go back very soon so I can work my way through every dish! If you're looking for a quiet meal - this isn't the place but it's a lively, welcoming place with nice service and I find it hard to think that veggie loving foodies wouldn't like it!"

Our starters were nice and looking at the menu they really sold the vegetarian burger - so much so that 4 out of 5 of us had it, it sounded delicious on the menu but tasted absolutely awful - I have eaten a lot of vege burgers in my time and even made them it is not difficult to get right so was very dissapointed that a so called vegetarian restaurant could get something so simple so wrong, i've had better vege burgers in weathersppons. The bread was really dry, the burgers were like cardboard i could only manage 1 x bite, the sweet potato fries weren't cooked all the way through and the sauce was disgusting.

We got there just before it opened as you cannot reserve a table, and once inside we were shown to a table right out the back where it was lovely and bright with light coming down from the sky-light windows above. Unfortunately our waiter seemed like he would rather have been anywhere else but working that day, as he was blunt to the point of rudeness and didn't once say please or thank you throughout our whole meal. Fortunately though the food was absolutely superb - no question about it, even for me a confirmed meat eater. We chose the fig and blue cheese salad and the halloumi to start, and both had the yellow pepper, courgette and carrot burger for main course. All perfectly created and perfectly cooked - totally delicious! The restaurant filled up in no time and then seemed rather cramped, we felt they had packed in as many little tables as they possibly could have - this made it difficult to have a private conversation but after a of glass of their lovely organic sparkling wine this didn't bother us too much! I would definitely recommend Mildred's as a no-frills lunch venue; the service was very quick, the food plentiful and tasty, and two courses each with wine came to £48 - a bargain for central London. My tips: makes sure you get there just before they open at 12pm to get a table out the back; and insist on tap water - they bring you a big carafe with ice and fruit!"

For instance, the ale pie used to be a favourite but when you can instantly judge the number of peas (18) and chips (4 and some dog ends - and all sodden with grease at that) then the above approach applies. AND I was starving beforehand but refused to give them any further business, especially at these prices. I would rather pay more and have a guaranteed excellent meal at The Gate.Are they living on their reputation or their results? It's the former for me."

We bought a botlle of wine when we arrived (house red perfectly nice) and waited in the bar for a table. The tables are close together but it has a buzzy atmosphere and everyone is really friendly. The service is efficient and cheerful. We just want to eat everything on the menu, but this time went for some of the specials on the board as well as from the standard menu. The food arrives reasonable quickly but you don't feel rushed. Everything we have had has had a depth of flavour and an authenticity of its provenance e.g. Thai curry tasted as it does in Thailand, bruschetta could have been in an Italian deli. The only disappointment was a dearth of chickpeas in a chickpea and squash curry. We commented to the waitress and she did apologise. Managed a pudding, though not all of it; they are quite huge, but good.Looking forward to our next visit."

It's always very very busy so you have to be lucky to get in, but we almost always do and if we have to wait then we do because it's worth it. The only thing I could point out is that without fail I am always slightly disappointed with the service. If it wasn't for the food being SO good I probably wouldn't go back as often as I do. They barely look at you as they collect your plates, never ask if anything is Ok and don't say thank you when you pay the bill.

They were standard London prices, which was a bit more expensive than I'd like, but good for a once-in-awhile treat, and they were pretty tasty too! We then moved onto our table, where we were a bit squashed in to be honest. I know that is the atmosphere of the place, but that's not really what you expect for a fairly hefty price tag. We had wine and chatted (which was difficult at times due to the noise levels) and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I know us meaties always go on about ""not missing the meat"", but I genuinely didn't. But then, I don't require a bit of dead animal in all my meals. And my friend loved it too, I think she had been before though. The menu was inventive, and the food well-prepared. The prices were a little steep for this-is-only-vegetables, but there was a skill and finesse in many of the dishes that warranted some of the price levels - also they have to do something to reign in the busy!The waiters and waitresses were all very polite, but a little hipster and look-down-your-nosey for my liking (but this IS London after all). The bill I don't remember completely, but for a cocktail each, a bottle of wine and two courses, it was around £70-£80 for the two of us.I certainly don't earn enough to go there every night for hipster vegetables, but it was an enjoyable evening nonetheless."

We made room for dessert also and tried the cheese cake and the sticky toffee pudding - amazing! Our bill was £60 which I thought was good for 3 courses each, 2 glasses of wine and 1 soft drink.We didn't have to wait for a table at all but we did start eating at about 6pm - it was definitely busy when we left later but then this is December and I imagine people were on Christmas nights out? Will definitely be back - only complaint is the amount of choice - I'm not used to being able to choose anything off a menu (normally just looking at veg option on normal menus!)"

I had mushroom pie and chips with mushy peas, which was excellent - so nice to be able to have pie and chips again!!Pudding-wise we shared a pear crumble and a pannetone bread and butter pudding. Of the two I preferred the B&B pudding, but both were good.By this time I felt stuffed and just finished with an espresso.I had a blend of juices with my meal which was really refreshing.All of the waiting staff were really friendly and chatty despite the fact that it got really busy.It's quite informal and as it's not an enormous place you are in quite close proximity to neighbouring diners.We paid about £30 per head for 3 courses and a couple of drinks.It was excellent and will definitely eat there again.I hope you find my review helpful."

The menu looked excellent, but the food didn't quite live up to my expectation. All 3 courses were just a little underwhelming. This place is certainly trendy, but the food is almost there. A little bit of tweaking would see it be an excellent vegetarian restaurant. The toffee pudding was a little dry, the pumpkin and ricotta ravioli was a little tough and the haloumi a little undercooked. Having said that, the food was still enjoyable, but if they just improved things a little, this would be a fantastic place. The sweet potato chips were excellent though. I would probably go back, but not with as high expectations.There are no reservations, so be prepared to wait in the bar to get a table."

Mildred's doesn't take reservations.Service was excellent -- at one point two different servers arrived simultaneously with clean knives and forks! We had the grilled artichoke crostini and a special mushroom starter with caramelized onions and blue cheese. The main dishes were a sweet potato curry and Asian stir fry. Both were seasoned well although the stir fry was a little too greasy for my taste. Even though the restaurant officially closed at 11 p.m. they offered us coffee and dessert and we never felt hurried.The only annoying thing was a table of raucous drunk 20 something chicks. Otherwise it was a great choice for post-theatre eats.

The menu was largely the same but each had their benefits. Unfortunately, due to the economy and all sorts of reasons, they've been forced to close the cafe and try and offer a takeaway service in their restaurant during the day instead. Food quality has not suffered but seating is now more restricted.So onto the restaurant experience itself.....I have been an avid meat eater all my life and don't apologise for being so. I don't agree with the cruel manufacturing methods but that's a discussion for another forum. Anyway, my point is that until the last couple of years, my impression of vegetarian food was generally not positive - my assumption was that the bland and uninspired offerings at other venues were representative of vegetarian cuisine as a whole.Mildred's was one of the first restaurants to change my mind. They offer a very nice range of vegetarian/vegan items with veggie versions of familiar favourites such as lasagne and burgers and a mushroom ale pie, there's something for even the most cautious diner to try. On the topic of their Lasagne - It is seriously one of the best i've had in a very long time, creamy and soft with a rich cheese sauce and vegetable filling - definitely check it out.The one thing that lets this place down is (as mentioned previously) the service. Unfortunately it varies from ""rushed and impersonal"" to almost downright rude. Please don't let this deter you from what is otherwise a wonderful establishment (with enough vegan options so that everyone has something to choose from)."

The food is fantastic, especially the mushroom and ale pie and the sweet potato fries.... the flatbread is always yummy too. There's a huge amount of choice (lots of healthy options too) and the prices are reasonable... not cheap, but i'm more than happy to pay for the quality of the food. Mildred's is always packed in the evenings and as you are unable to book a table, you invariably have to wait...although never more than about 15 mins or so (and there's always the bar to keep you entertained!). However, because the restaurant is quite small (cosy and atmospheric, but small...), it ends up getting a little bit overcrwded and you end up hovering around the bar, pretty close to people who are trying to enjoy their meals, which isn't that fun for either party. This feeling of everything being a bit overcrowded continues after you are seated - the tables are extremely close together and you can usually hear exactly what the table next to you are saying and vice versa (or maybe i'm just a bit nosy!) The service is usually pretty unfriendly and rushed (although never rude or unpleasant). It's definately not the kind of place where you feel like taking your time over a bottle of wine,,, especially not with the que of people at the bar eagarly waiting to be seated. Basically, if Mildred's was two or three times the size, it would probably be my favourite restaurant ever! I just feel that the lack of space results in a not particularly pleasant dining experience and staff who are under a bit too much pressure. I kind of feel like eating out should be relaxing and it's a bit tricky when you feel like you're sat on top of the table next to you. However, like I said, the food is incredibly tastey, the choice is fab, the prices are reasonable, the location is nice and central and so I would definately recommend giving it a go."

I do agree with some of the previous comments re-service, maybe because the place is so busy and quite cramped the staff are under pressure, however little things like smiling and a warm greeting on arrival would make this experience even better. You cannot book unless you are in a large party so if you are heading for a mid week dinner make it early it you want to be sure of a table without waiting, we arrived at 6.45pm and just squeezed in.

At times, the grumpiness of the front of house staff is simply breathtaking. The detox salad and tagine are legendary staples and excellent every time, and the puddings are great too. However, everything you read about the bad service on this site is true - which is harsh on most of the serving staff, who are generally friendly and helpful. However, on my recent visit, it really must be said that the manager and barman, who appear to run the place, are beyond any level of surliness I have ever experienced in a restaurant in London or elsewhere. There was a queue of about 6 people, including us, who were left standing at the bar for at least 15 minutes waiting to be seated, even though there were tables free. During this time, there was only the most cursory acknowledgment of our existence, and we were made to feel as if we were imposing ourselves on their busy routine, which included singing and dancing to cool music while the customers queued up. The food and the helpfulness of the other waiters did make the experience less awful, but the manager's superhuman surliness really did take the gloss off a celebratory meal that my friends and I were really looking forward to. It really was traumatic enough for me to consider never going back again."

So when her sister, who lives abroad, wanted to treat her for a birthday lunch, I took her to Mildred's where she could have the free run of the menu.Ordering took an aeon as my wife simply wasn;t used to the choice. Eventually, after much deliberation, we oredered. She, the lentil cake special and I the chargrilled roman style artichoke crostini with lemon aioli to start which were both absolutely delicious. I was so impressed with the flavours. For our mains, we both couldn't resist the burrito filled with black turtle beans, corn and red pepper topped with tomato lime salsa, guacamole, smoked cheddar and sour cream with a leaf salad. We were both right to choose the same thing as again, it was fantastic. As for the deseert - she is still talking about it now... raspberry and cassis chocolate truffle. It was seriously good.THe service was friendly and prompt. The interior decor was a lot more informal than we expected from the impression given on the website. Not that that was a problem.Next time we're down in London, we shall definitely be paying another visit. I recommend you do too, even if you are a raging carnivore."

Turns out it didn't. The star of our dinner would have to be the waitress who spilled water over our table while serving, not noticing this as she (not unlike the thee others - who serviced our table) never made eye contact with us during our sitting. I don't much mind the spilling in itself, it's feeling as though the staff makes a point of not taking notice of you that leaves one with a bitter aftertaste. Well, to be fair I believe we got a smile from one of the guys serving. Sadly, one out of four is just not good enough.The food in itself was decent, as were the wine we had to go with it. I had the borlotti bean and sunblushed tomato sausages with spring onion mash, and while the sausage was quite dry the mash was moist enough to offer a nice contrast. My date chose the burger of the day and while it wasn't the best veggieburger he'd had, the plate was cleared from food, thus wholly eatable. I appreciate hearty, ambitious, veggie cooking so based purely on the meny I'd probably return...Taking under concideration the whole experience with quite unfriendly staff and a locale that's noisy and sterile (though the roof window is quite lovely!) and prices that don't really reflect on quality.. well, we won't be back."

This was based on previously looking at the menu and the odd recommendation about value in various guides. For the most part we were not disappointed. The food was substantial, tasty and put together with some imagination. It wasn't refined cooking but it was decent value for money and we ate everything put in front of us. Main courses of vegetable tagines and a splendidly flavoured mushroom and ale pie served with moreish chips and mushy peas rather captured what we took to be the essence of the place. Starters and a subsequent cheesecake were eaten but with slightly less enthusiasm. We drank several glasses of both white and red wine and would almost certainly have benefited financially from having a bottle. The wine was not Mildred's strong point but it was noticeable that many of the considerable number of other customers were workers for whom presumably alcohol was a non-starter. We would have done better to stick with the smoothies. Service could not have been more amiable and willing but it could also have been brisker and more efficient.If you think about eating here be clear about the kind of restaurant it is. You will certainly be well fed and it won't need to cost the earth. But it will have some rough edges and you have to like slightly rustic well-flavoured vegetarian cooking. With those qualifications I have no hesitation in recommending Mildred's as an enjoyable stopping off place."

So on our latest trip to London, we wanted to go somewhere special to eat and had checked Tripadvisor to find the vegetarian restaurants with the best review. When we arrived at Mildred's on a Friday night, it was packed with people waiting, and we were told it would be about an hour's wait. So we decide to walk around to another vegetarian restaurant not far away (Tibits). We were so disappointed with what we saw, when we got there. It is not really a proper table service restaurant, but rather a serve-yourself, fancy salad and hot veges bar, but a lot of the food looked pretty ordinary. It's fine for lunch but certainly not for a nice night out. So we decided we would go back to Mildred's and wait it out , and we were so glad we did. The crowd had thinned out and there was only one other group waiting before us and we got a table within about 15 minutes. The choices were great and the decisions of what to have were hard! Everything my husband and I ate was unusual, tasty and delicious. My artichoke starter was superb, and i couldn't stop myself raving about the linguine (""this is soooo good!) the whole time i was eating it. Be careful if ordering the cornbread though. It has chilli in it and has quite a spicy bite to it, which I had not expected, since it was not included in the description. We shared the coconut, banana and tofu tart for desert. Note to chef: my personal preference was to have a lot more coconut in it, to take the edge off too much tofu flavour; after all the tofu is in the mix to give the texture, rather than an actual flavour. Nevertheless, it was still very nice. My husband really enjoyed the organic red wine.The best part of visiting this restaurant was that the prices were very reasonable, because you are not paying for expensive meat content.We can't wait to go back."

England.","On Thursday I took a colleague for lunch at Mildreds on Lexington Street. Mildreds is a vegetarian restaurant in the heart of Soho that has been running for years.I've always liked Mildreds. I'm not a vegetarian but it has the most exciting vegetarian menu around. Plus it caters for people who are gluten and diary intolerant which is just brilliant. My parents are both coeliacs so I know how hard it is to find menus that work.We hadn't booked a table, in fact I'm not sure you can book a table, so strolled in at just before 1pm. It's always busy and packed to the rafters. It's a quirky place. I guess you'd call it shabby chic. Luckily there were a few tables spare so we went through to the back dining room.There are a few high tables and stools at the front of the restaurant but really all the action takes place towards the back.As well as the substantial menu there is a specials board which changes daily. The menu is solid and strong with lots of great dishes that sound amazing. To whet your appetite, here are some of the highlights:Tomato, aubergine, chickpea and green olive tagine served with flaked almond cous cous, flat bread and harissa.Sundried tomato and buffalo mozzarella risotto cake served with wilted spinach, green beans and grape mustard cream sauce.Linguini with courgette and pistachio pesto, served with cherry tomatoes and rocket.Borlotti bean and sunblushed tomato sausages served with pumpkin and sweet potato mash, broccoli and apple cider jus.Mixed mushroom, porcini and ale pie served with fries and mushy peas.As you can see, inventive and delicious even for a meat eater!There is a special burger of the day. On Thursday is was courgette and sweet red pepper. We ordered two burgers with cheese and sweet potato fries and settled in.The food arrived in good time and looked amazing. Two delicious burgers that looked as good as they tasted. Rich and meaty (even though they were meat free) they oozed taste and texture. The cheese complimented the burger well. The bread was perhaps a little lacking. The sweet potato fries OK.Two burgers and two soft drinks came to £34 including service.Service can be a little hit and miss. It's good but the staff can be down right rude at times. Attitude rules supreme. However if you can get past this then it's worth a visit.www.mildreds.co.ukFor more reviews check out --"

One of us comitted the unforgivable sin of asking for a diet coke....not sure if it was that or just hatred of work but the waitress attitude really spoilt the expereince. Not one smile at all. Ever. And no voluntary conversation or assistance. We did pay the 12 1/2% service charge because the other two guys worked really hard (and smiled occasionally!). Food was nice on the whole but the mushroom pie was very strong and seemed to smell strongly of 'bisto' (surely not!). The place is small, popular and very noisy. Has a definate cafe feel with formica tables. We left with divided opinions, but for approx £70 for a one course meal and one drink each for 4 people we will probably opt for a more cheeful atmosphere."

I was there once during London Fashion Week for lunch and was one of 2 males in the place. The rest were models. OK, now I am day dreaming. Great burgers of the day. The Mushroom and Ale pie with mushy peas and chips is pure heaven. Great beer and wine selections. I have been going to Mildreds since the old venue. I love the stunning photographs of the amusement parks of the world including Blackpool and Coney Island. Well, I just love going to Mildred's."

Not just salads and tofu, Mildred's offers an excellent selection of meals. I had the mushroom and ale pie with chips and mushy peas, a great spin on a carnivore classic.

What it does mean however is that the menu is starting to get a little too familiar, but luckily there are always tasty specials on offer too. The sweet potato fries with mayo are fab, as are the veggie burgers and the burrito. I have never had a bad meal here, and even my truly meat devoted friends have enjoyed the food here. The dishes are really filling. The service and surroundings leave for something to be desired, but that could just be a part of the whole 'thing'. You will always have to wait for a table for up to 30 minutes, but the time goes by smoothly at the bar at the front of the restaurant."
