I was highly disappointed. The staff were lovely though I cant fault themAs a vegan all lives matter including the environment and apart from the bad food I feel more obliged to talk about the amount of unnecessary waste of plastic. I get that its biodegradable but thats still waste. Everything comes on/in cardboard or plastic. The sauce holders are plastic, the cups the knifes and forks. The salads are in cardboard as are the plates, there are no mugs its all takeaway cup coffee. Why? I just dont get it. I saw a review from early last year saying they were looking into more sustainable ways....come on its been a year and I'm sure its been brought up before. Is it because the cost of plates? The cost of having someone wash up the plates? The cost of staff then having to table wait? All the answers seem like they head to profit for the place (sorry i cant even call it a restaurant because its not). My friend had a slad costing her ten pounds, it consisted of mainly lettuce 4 tiny cubes of avocado and 3 croutons.... she was still hungry after. 10 pounds! Come on there wasnt even any seitan or anythinh in a caesar salad. I had some form of mock chicken burger which was breaded and fell apart in my hands.The cheese was overpowering there was so much of it and it didn't taste nice at all. The lemonade wasnt just lemon it had some other flavour which isnt mentioned at all. The signage of then how to dispose of all this plastic is non existent so you then have to go through your mound of cardboard and plastic to see what goes where. Does stuff contaminated with food go in recycling? It honestly needs so much work and I'm sorry for having to write such a negative review but it was upsetting at how little effort has gone into this place. Its essentially an Instagram trap with neon lights and hanging chairs to take pictures and get likes. I really sincerely hope this place changes"

They loved the burger, and the non-vegan enjoyed the guac burger but found it a bit messy to eat as it was large and served in a bag not on a plate (probably an age thing!). Cookies were tasty.

Cakes looked nice but waiter served us the wrong one. I wanted blueberry but after eating half looking for the blueberries and realizing it was just a lemon muffin, couldn't change it. All the cakes taste of lemon, fine if you like lemon! They do sell beer (5,50 a bottle.) The server couldn't speak English so I suggest they put pictures of the food and drinks at the tills for customers to point to. We wouldn't go back. I suppose if they called it a coffee bar and not a restaurant you'd go in with a different mindset, accepting the mcdonalds like plastic cutlery, throw away plates and queue to order. A lot of wadte for a vegan place. Not for us unfortunately"

I've been veggie for 20 years, but my partner has gone straight from eating meat and dairy to following a vegan diet. We ordered a burger with chips and a Quinoa Taco salad and halved everything to share. Even though it was delicious, I thought the burger was really quite small. It was more like a large starter! Chips were expensive too at £4. Both sauces were amazing though, especially the beetroot ketchup! The salad was the winner for me here and I'd definitely get that again - the spicy seiten was amazing! Glad we went but will probably try a few of the other vegetarian/vegan restaurants and cafes around the area before coming back!"

I ordered the smoothie as well but the smoothie machine was broken and wouldn’t be fixed in half an hour so the server called me to offer lemonade. Which was nice and they offered to pick any Bakery items to make up the difference in price. Customer service was spot on. The guys serving at the counter are really good.

Half a slice of bread and that was £9 but we decided to add avocado on for £2 extra and I'm not joking when I say it was probably less than a 1/4 of browning avocado. Not impressed.

The menu looks promising, with some interesting vegan alternatives to the regular 'meat or veggie' fare in Covent Garden. We went for the early bird at £9 with extra Avocado for £2. The menu states 'mixed greens' on the side. This ended up being some pittiful salad drenched in a very vinagar based dressing. The portions here are tiny for what you pay. The tofu scrambled eggs were tasty, the sausage patty was cloying and sticky, half a slice of toast and a quarter of a brown avocado (for £2 extra!!!) The food was luke warm, you he coffee was rather dull and unsatisfying. Save your money and travel to Unity Diner for a much better vegan experience. My score of two is for the devote...not including the smelly and unclean toilets. Disappointed."

You know like, funny tasting water... it tasted off! And to top it off my muffin had black hairs in it. I actually had to spit it into my napkin sat at the table which was embarrassing, it was disgusting! And not cheap let me add. I felt so bad as my boyfriend had just paid a stupid price for hideous food. We will never go back here. Clearly the hygiene standards were very low. Such a disappointment."

Things got off to a rocky start when I ordered; as I couldn't see any combo deals on the menu, I mentioned the board I'd seen outside advertising a burger, fries, and a drink for £12.95. I asked if this deal was still available, and was told that it was - so I ordered it. As I was swiping my card, I noticed it said £15.75 rather than £12.95 - but it was too late, as my card was too close and had already registered. I asked why I was paying a different price than the one advertised outside, and the person taking my order apologised, saying that he'd put the items separately instead of in a combo - which I found surprising, considering that that's how I'd started my order, by mentioning the combo. I was asked if I'd like a cupcake or cookie as a reimbursement - but as I don't usually eat dessert I asked for an actual monetary reimbursement, which I was given.I was given a buzzer and told to wait until my order was done. So I waited. And waited. After 30 minutes of waiting, I went back to the till to ask if everything was okay - I had somewhere to go to after, and I just couldn't wait much longer. The girl who helped me (not the man who took my order) was lovely and very apologetic; my order had been standing there going cold for a very long time, but it hadn't been properly labeled, which is why my buzzer hadn't gone off. She told me to wait five more minutes while they made the order again (the original one was very cold) and gave me a cookie as compensation for the half-hour wait. Overall, I can't say I was treated badly; mistakes, when pointed out, where straightened out and apologised for, so this is not at all meant as a dig to the staff. I guess what I'm saying is to keep an eye out for mistakes, as they're very easily made. My food was nice, and nobody was rude or unfriendly - but I just can't consider almost being ripped off for £3 (a considerable percentage of the total cost) and 35 minutes of waiting around for absolutely no reason a good experience."

It’s actually with a heavy heart that I write this as I don’t particularly enjoy penning a bad review. Let’s start with the positives. The place itself is aesthetically beautiful and modern with hanging, wooden seat swings, a fresh and clean feel and gender neutral toilets. My partner sampled the pesto meatball sandwich which was lovely if a tad sparse on the meatball offerings. I ordered ‘the classic burger’ which looked appetising upon arrival but unfortunately that’s as far as it went. It was the thinnest burger patty I’ve ever seen and was burnt to such an extent I could’ve used it as a hockey puck. Because of this it’s taste was dry, overly salty and very bitter. We both ordered fresh fruit smoothies from the specials board which tasted exceptionally bland-I feel too much ice and very little fruit was used to create these overpriced concoctions. Overall it was a disappointing, overpriced experience and one I won’t be repeating."

We ordered the Mornin Glory expecting an actual brunch but instead got a load of things slopped into a heavy industrial bun. The ""sausage"" is a dry patty, and the bun was like a rock. The scrambled tofu was delicious but it was leaking out of the bun and I couldn't really enjoy it. Maybe the menu needs to be written more clearly as we didn't expect a basic breakfast sandwich for nearly £10. I also ordered the hash browns (note the plural) but it was just one.

Although the food was ok (I really liked the meatballs burger but my friend had the driest salad she’d ever had), I was very surprised that the tableware available to customers was plastic! It is rather unimaginable that at this point in time, such a forward-thinking chain like this (because of its vegan nature) still has single use plastic cups and cutlery for customers’ use.I will not be going back because of this. It would be so much better to have normal re usable tableware that you wash. Very very sad to see such plastic in the bin (they will claim it’s recyclable and compostable but we all know that’s not good enough and is a very grey area)."

There was barely any avocado on the toast, just a thin layer spread across. The bread was INEDIBLE. It genuinely smelt like cardboard and paint mixed together which was really really off-putting.I had a couple of bites to taste and nothing in it tasted even average at all - it tasted how it smelt.I would not recommend - I have heard bad reviews about their famous guac burger so I’m not sure if anything on the menu is worth it really.Will not be visiting again."

This branch was opened on 25th July 2019 (2 days ago) and the operation isn't smooth yet. Never mind, the staff is pleasant and well-intentioned and they will get there. My issue is with the food we tried; the famous guac burger proved to be a disappointment: lukewarm, mushy texture, tastes OK but nothing special and boasts a hefty £9 price-tag. The sweet potato fries were fine. The beer (not tap, they are yet to set that up) lukewarm. Overall it's a fast food joint with restaurant prices. Not impressed."

Was quickly disappointed walking in, when I asked at the till to swap the maple sausage for the spicy chorizo and was told that they wouldn’t be able to swap and I would need to pay £2 extra to add the chorizo on. The service we experienced was rude and unwelcoming, the food when it arrived was very sub-standard and definitely not worth paying £11 for. I ordered a cold pressed juice thinking it would be freshly made and it turned out to be from a plastic bottle. Would definitely recommend finding somewhere else to eat if you don’t want to overpay for a very basic meal."

My sandwich was quite soggy and my son had the ‘fish’ and chips which I tried, but was just plain and boring tofu, it was so expensive for the meagre amount he got. The chips were nice though as were the mushy peas. Nice smoothie too, but over £5 for a small glass! I do appreciate this is London and don’t expect cheap, but do expect good quality food. The cake we had was rather dry and uninspiring. By contrast we went to a different vegan restaurant the following day and prices were similar, but the food and service were excellent by comparison.

This is a vegan fast food restaurant that is marketed as more high end but I’m not sure how they can justify their prices when the produce is very average. I would at least expect home made nacho chips for that price but they serve shop bought ones. The meatball sub was quite tasty in itself but the kale dip was far too salty and the nacho chips were just cheap manufactured ones. My brother’s girlfriend was even more disappointed. She chose a burger without bun, as they don’t offer gluten free and had even tried to charge her for the extra salad leaves on the side! She was not at all impressed. The meal was below average at best. I will not be recommending this restaurant to any vegan friends and I shan’t be coming back."

It was a disappointing experience. The burger we ordered was quiet bad. It had an overload on lettuce, very cold guacamole which made the whole burger cold. The burger itself had no flavour, the only thing you could taste was the sauce. The lentil soup was blend. The pasta pesto had a very good taste but if the menu says it has cherry tomatoes I expect a bit more than literally 1,5 micro tomato. It was not over expensive but way too much money for what you get. I would not recommend it."

I asked if this was recyclable and was told by the staff that they didn’t think it was. I then asked if they could serve my food on a plate and my drink in a cup that could be washed up in order to avoid the plastic waste, after a bit of back and forth discussing that the plates they had wouldn’t be big enough for a salad we finally found a suitable option which required no single use plastics. However, I also noticed that the pots for the sauces weren’t recyclable. Most of the vegan places I have eaten at also had an emphasis on being environmentally friendly so the fact that there was so much plastic waste from this vegan restaurant was very surprising, and not in a good way. It would definitely put me off returning."

It was pretty dry and definitely not worth the price of about £8 (I cant remember how much exactly). The cake was okay but again a little dry. All the food and the coffee was served on takeaway boxes even though we were staying in to eat. This seemed like a waste and a little lazy to me, as if they couldn't be bothered to wash up. Perhaps there is a reason they do this, I don't know. Yes it was cool it was all vegan but you can definitely find some more cosy and friendly places to eat in London. It depends what you are looking for I guess."

Even the chocolate chip cookie has nuts in and they don’t point this out on the menu or on the sign. I would have gone ahead and eaten it if I hadn’t asked the staff before I did (after I had already touched it). It’s disappointing that there are still places being so careless with their allergens. Someone with a severe allergy could die from eating something such as a chocolate chip cookie which you wouldn’t typically expect to contain nuts. I would say the food is good however I would be extremely cautious if you have a nut allergy. Luckily mine isn’t so bad so I was able to touch the cookie with no reaction, however there are so many people with terrible allergies who could have got seriously ill. I would have given a good review otherwise however I don’t think this is acceptable when people’s lives can be put in danger."

However we did decide to break the boycott for our visit to London so we can try them here.We took the fish & chips which was nice (tofu “meat” nori sheet for fishy flavor, then batter) but didn’t beat out our favourite vegan fish & chips we had. The also had the Morning Glory which read to us on the menu as a breakfast plate but was in reality a sandwich. It doesn’t use the word “sandwich” anywhere in the menu which I would recommend they do to lessen confusion. The sandwich was nice, especially liked the type of bun they used. All pretty high quality - which was reflected in the price. All in all it was decent but not mind-blowing when set against our high standards for vegan food in London."

Being healthy definitely gives it a kick up the list (they offer Gluten free on most dishes too for an additional price). Love their meatball sub, avocado toast and the air baked sweet potato fries. Definitely give the sauces a go too which is available on the side - beet ketchup and alioli - both super yummy!

I ordered the Fish & Chips which was the perfect size and £8.90 was a fair price for it. We were offered a sample of the afternoon tea menu which was a nice way to to promote a new menu and the options were very tasty! The only downside is that there was a lot of single use plastic served with the meal, including all the cutlery and the containers for sauces and my coffee was served in a takeaway disposable cup. This is unfortunate as since we were sitting in they really should’ve provided reusable items.

And unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. As the other reviews already mention: yes, the prices are high and yes, the portions are small. But what bothered me mostly was how misleading the meal descriptions are. We ordered The Early Bird and The Sunrise from the Brunch Menu, and had a beet smoothie and an ice tea. The Early Bird was set up so poorly, had a weird tasting “patty” instead of a sausage and a tofu scramble which tasted like nothing, whereas The Sunrise came as a Wrap but tasted good. The ice tea was literally just black tea with ice cubes, no flavours, nothing. What we were wondering is, why can’t the food be describes how it really is? We were expecting a proper vegan fry up and get a small wrap. All in all we just feel scammed. I’d definitely never come again."

Not a sweet fan but both sweet and savoury nibbles were delicious! Beef tomato ‘smoked salmon’ was amazing, would have liked some more of each of the sandwiches as one tiny finger each wasn’t quite enough but very tasty. Few negative things. Staff didn’t seem to know what they were doing, I was sat down and left for a while and wasn’t sure if we ordered at the bar or what. Only seemed to be one person on the floor who seemed a bit confused. Didn’t ask for refills on drinks even though it was unlimited on coffee and tea. No water offered either which i find odd. The tablecloth has crayons and pictures to colour which was cute but there’d been a spill of tea and it had been left on the table which was a little grim, what else are they leaving dirty?..Worst thing though was all the one use items! Paper cups, cutlery and plants! Recyclable or not- that’s no excuse. Playing the vegan card but not being environmentally friendly doesn’t really match up. Get real cutlery and crockery!!! All in all okay visit, it would be a 5/5 was it just down to food but unfortunately the overall experience didn’t match the quality of food."

In the picture below you can see that I bought the 'sunrise' brunch and an iced matcha. This cost £12 - £9 for the burrito and £3 for the matcha. For this money I received a very small burrito that was consumed in about 4 bites. The matcha had no flavour whatsoever. Me and my friend both left feeling hugely disappointed and quite frankly robbed. The service is nonexistent and the person at the till barely gave us a smile. This is NOT what vegan food is about. It should not be this expensive. I don't understand how you can justify the below items costing £12.This restaurant is simply catering to people who pay for (average!) restaurant decor and a brand name.Avoid at all costs.

My sisters had highly recommend By Chloe as they eat there all the time in the states. This one is clearly not at the same standard.This restaurant however was a complete disappointment. The staff were rude and unhelpful. They really couldn't care less about their service, which is a shame considering how costly the food is and there is no self service. They made more than one mistake with our orders and looked at us in complete disgust that we had come back to the counter with a complaint. My daughter asked for plain pasta with cheese, no topping at all and they still added it, insisting that's when I ordered, we then had to wait an exceptionally long time for it to be fixed, almost everyone had finished their meal, having to wait for a six year old to wait for her food to cook down before eating. All of the hot drinks looked and tasted watered down. The second lot didn't come back out much better. The food sizes are ridiculously small and over prices. Service is terrible.

The burgers were as thin as cardboard and with similar consistency and, while I did have good fun facetiously criticising the description of 'air baked fries' (are most chips baked in a Vacuum!?), the chips were disappointingly soggy. No crisp to them whatsoever. Having said that, the salads that I saw looked nice and the vegan Mac and Cheese was tasty, which is a difficult dish to pull off - my attempts taste like baby food. The cookies were also lovely which redeems this review to a generous 3 stars.I think the lesson in this is that to be happy as a food lover and Vegan, we shouldn't be trying to replicate meat/dairy heavy products and expect similar standards. There's so many types of cuisine and fusion dishes out there that are vegan, new and taste good without trying to come up with substandard meat alternatives. More broadly, it was depressing to see how many people in the restaurant were more concerned with taking photos of and with their food in the beautifully designed restaurant than eating it. Call me old fashioned but I usually go to restaurants for good food and company rather than 'doing it for the (insta)gram'."

In fact we left still feeling hungry despite a heavy bill! 2 leaves of lettuce and 2 spoons of scrambled tofu.. for the crazy price of £9?!? Ok you need to pay a high rent in convent garden but come on!! A tiny empty dish for the price of a main?! Moreover containing food that is so basic and that should be so inexpensive to eat! Why do you need to make eating vegan so inaccessible? Why all this marketing and crazy money for such basic food?! Plus why not providing plates and cutlery rather than everything being for one use only?! I don’t care your plates and plastic cutlery is recycable and compostable! Isn’t it better for the environment to wash a plate rather than encourage single use?! Veganism is about protecting the environment. Businesses like this just want to milk the vegan cow while it’s for many just a fashionable trend! You are just the opposite of what eating a plant based diet should be! Charge lettuce at £9?!?

Burgers are generally good, pasta was nice, mac n’cheese was meh, fries nice, nacho chips good (but you get virtually none) drinks were varied and the cakes were OK. 2) Cost - crazy high. £9-12 for a burger ....not a meal, just a burger. So add another £4 for fries! (regular portion) and another £4-6 for a drink. Very, very expensive which would be fine if portion sizes were good.....but they are not. This was the biggest downside. Looking at close to £80 for a family of 4. A non vegan place would be 1/4 of this. 3) waste - so much plastic and cardboard waste after the meal. Almost unacceptably so! You are eating vegan but you can’t help but feel you are also destroying the environment as a result of the plastic cutlery, cups, straws, sauce holders etc. Overall a good one time experience, but wouldn’t go again.

Initially it was very quiet but soon filled up. There is a nice relaxed ambiance with simple decor, though the tables are a bit on the small side!! We ordered the Mac and cheese, guac burger with sweet potato fries and the pesto meatball sub. The Mac and cheese was okay, it didn’t have much flavour and had a very soft almost baby food like consistency. The guac burger was also a disappointment as it was cold and was also an odd baby food like texture as there was far too much guacamole in it in relation to the other components of the burger. However, the sweet potato fries and pesto meatball sub were delicious!! We really enjoyed the pesto sub, the bread was lovely as was the pesto and marinara sauce. We then ordered an array of desserts including the chocolate chip cookie, sticky toffee pudding, chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting and the birthday cake ice cream pop. The cookie was by far the best item we ordered. The sticky toffee pudding was the odd baby food like consistency and the cupcake was very powdery, not like the usual vegan cakes you get that have a normal consistency. Overall it was okay, we ended up paying £45 for all we ordered so it was £15 per head. Not sure if we’d return but it was nice to try it at least!!"

The fries were very good, the smoothies were nice but the pesto 'meatballs' were stodgy greasy, over salted and uninspired and there was not enough contrast of the general clagginess of the sub roll they were served in. When there are so many great herbs and spices and recipes for dressings - it needed to be lighter and fresher and the flavours needed to pop and they unfortunately didn't. Perhaps we simply ordered the wrong thing on the menu but what we had was personally very disappointing. We also felt it was all too expensive for what it was."

There were just two stains of the ketchup, the patty, though tasty, was exetremely salty (and I love salt), there were 2 small pickles and a stain of sauce. Surprisingly the whole thing tasted pretty much like McDonalds which is a good since they’re aiming for the fast food experience. The fries cost additional 4£.

On one occasion, I ordered the gluten free classic burger. Despite the bun being gluten free, I had a gluten reaction which is very specific symptom and time from eating wise. I went through a whole process with them to work out what happened but they didn't resolve it. They did reassure me at the time that it was a one off incident. A few months later having eaten a couple of successful meals there, I decided to brave the gluten free classic burger again. I was very specific that they needed to ensure that the correct gluten free products should be used, as per the output from my communication the previous time. I had exactly the same response in terms of gluten reaction which suggests more than cross contamination. I did communicate with the restaurant to let them know that this has shattered my confidence, but although I personally don't feel comfortable to eat there again, they need to remove the gluten free classic burger from their menu. I had no response.I think what probably happened is that they are consistently switching the bread to gluten free bread, but aren't realising that there is gluten in the tempeh used for the burger patty (which I raised the first time round) OR that kitchen staff are not selecting the gluten free burger patty if there is one."

The place was heaving and it was little confusing as whether we needed to find out own table or if we would be seated. I chose the small Mac N' Cheese and Kale Caesar as was very hungry. Mac N' Cheese was a good size, sufficiently gooey and looked super pretty. The fake bacon bits were yummy! Overall the dish was perhsps just tiny bit too sweet for my taste. The Kale Ceasar, however, was dressed with just the perfect savory vegan caesar dressing and had lot of interesting textures uncluding very generous amount of croutons.The portion size was huge so my pescaterian husband finished it off and loved it too. I also nibbled on my friend's chips from her Fish N' Chip dish (which I want to try next time). They were soo deliciously crunchy and perfect with citrussy and oniony tartar sauce. Considering the food is coming out fast and should not sit on the pass for long it was somewhat disappointing my husband's very tasty Classic Burger was cold (tepid at best) and my macncheese was not bubbling hot either. Unfortunately we had no time to take it back as we were rushing to theatre. However, as service generally was great I am sure this would have been dealt with satisfactorily. Overall we were very well fed and I'll definitely return to sample some of the other options."

I ordered the fish (deep fried tofu + nori) and chips (sweet potato), and my friend ordered the pesto pasta and we shared a Mexican salad. I found the food really tasty, although my friend said the pasta could have done with some more variation/vegetables in there. The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the seating. The chairs we had were awkward to sit on and the table wasn't really big enough for two people and their meals so we didn't feel we could relax or hang about for long.

Friends and I ordered our food individually from a menu which looked interesting and nice. However...at the time when both my friends collected their food, my coffee was ready and sitting on their counter but my food was not, so they did not activate the device that tells me to collect the order. We waited and waited, and 50 minutes later (!) my smoothie bowl was ready. They picked up the coffee that had been sitting on the side for the past hour, placed it on my tray and called me to come collect. I asked if that was the coffee that had been sitting there all this time (which was stone cold by now) and reluctantly they offered to make me another one.

Given how hyped this place is I expected so much more. The menu is small (the breakfast/brunch menu has more choice than the actual main menu!), the burgers were bland and bitter, the salad had so much oil I think the United States nearly invaded my plate and the mac and cheese just wasn’t good I’m afraid. I’m practicing veganism and if this is what life is like then I’m definitely going back to the dark side. The cookies and banana walnut bread were alright but way over priced, £3.80 for a small slice of banana walnut bread is the definition of daylight robbery. On a plus side though the beet ketchup and chipotle aioli were amazing. Service was great and everyone was super kind. The food itself is rubbish."

There was a good selection to choose from and Father had 'The Greek', a jam packed salad that was so filling he struggled to finish it, his verdict was that it was delocious! I had the 'Fish and Chips', which was deep fried tofu, chips and crushed peas, it was absolutly scrummy - i'm not normally a fan of tofu, but this was really tasty. What was also fun and unique was that we ate our meals sitting in wicker chairs hanging from the ceiling. Gently swinging whilst eating your dinner is, surprisingly, a really nice experience!

We loved what we tried from by Chloe in New York, so came with understandably high expectations for the London venue. Another factor to prejudice your expectations is that this place is massively hyped. In the case of NYC, by Chloe was not overhyped. In London, however, the food misses the mark by a long way. We're both well-travelled vegans, and were left pretty uninspired by the things we ordered here in London. The avocado on toast was pretty poor (served on really dull granary bread, like a door-stop slice of Warburtons), with watery, gloopy avocado, and, for some unknown reason, segments of (what tasted like) tinned oranges and a sprinkling of pomegranate. Not at ALL worth the £8+ it cost. The mac'n'cheese was absolutely rubbish - it was made with a recipe that you can find that begins with making something like a vegetable soup, and then adding nutritional yeast. The whole thing tasted overpoweringly of parsnips. Its only saving grace was the mushroom 'bacon' on the top of it, which was pleasant. I couldn't finish the rest of it though, and I'm relieved I only ordered the smallest size. The 'guac' burger, which is meant to be the big hit, was simply OK. Nothing special whatsoever, erring on the side of bland, with a veggie patty that you can grab in the freezer section of any supermarket. Probably the best thing about the London by Chloe was the drinking coconuts, which were massive and lovely. It's a shame for food sucked, though, especially because it cost us nearly £60 just for two quick meals and some baked goods to takeaway. (P.S. the baked goods have nothing on Sweets by Chloe NYC, which had some of the most astonishing cookies). Clearly the vision for the London branch is different, but for me it's a complete miss. Wouldn't recommend and won't be going back until I revisit NYC."

I love taking my friends here (especially the non-vegan ones) and they always love it and it opens their mind to vegan food!However, the food is quite expensive anyway and to have gluten free pasta, you're charged an extra £2 or an extra £1 for gluten free buns with the burgers. I do understand that gluten free products can be more expensive, but it means a small pot of mac and cheese comes to nearly £7 and that just doesn't seem reasonable! The small mac and cheese is around £4.60, I get charged almost an extra 50% for being intolerant. I love mac and cheese, but I rarely have it because it's so expensive. It also seems like some of the options, like the sandwiches or the pesto meatball sub, could be made gluten free if gluten free bread was provided.I will still visit when I'm in the area, as I love the burgers and fries! but I do feel really disappointed that I have to pay quite a lot more than my friends just because I have an intolerance that I can't do anything about.Also, they used to have wooden cutlery and it seems like they have now changed to plastic - I don't know if it's ""biodegradable plastic"", but I'm pretty sure that's less sustainable than wood. Why they would make this change is bizarre to me..."

She had the classic burger which for £9 didn't come with fries. The patty was very thin and bland and the fries we ordered were pale, dry and cold, so we had to send them back and get them replaced - thankfully the replacement was a lot better. I had the meatball sub which to be fair was pretty tasty though expensive at £9.60. The atmosphere was fine although some tables were quite small and close together. Overall the food wasn't terrible but it's overpriced for what you get. With a few implementable changes this place could be really great."

The minute you walk in it's a hive of bodies, to be expected in Covent Garden. A bit like any fast food takeaway, you order, pay for your food, are given a buzzer contraption when your order is ready and hope to find a seat to eat.My friend, a true vegan, asked our server questions about the food, whilst the young girl was friendly she didn't know the answers to the not so difficult questions. My friend asked what was on offer apart from salads. The young lady suggested fish and Chips made from tofu. Burgers and that really was it. My friend was disappointed to have travelled from Brighton, looking forward to this lovely vegan food to be offered meat/fish substitutes. I was not aware that the new £10 contained tallow. My friend refuses to handle polymer money due to her strong vegan beliefs. After we ordered she remarked that this could be any fast food outlet, it wasn't vegan to her. We ordered Kale salads, a smoothie and green tea. Tea was good, smoothie was great, worth £7.25 not really. Salad was salad.As we ate our lunch, nice as it was, we were aware of the diners looking for seats, not a place to converse or settle down.Toilets were spacious, messy, due to how busy the place is and minus a hand drier or paper towels!This is a typical fast food eaterie in the west end, no atmosphere, busy, customer is anyone. As we looked around my friend observed that the clientele were pretend vegans. As a meat eater, I really didn't get it until I thought about it later that day and felt her disappointment. Must be hard enough to find decent food to eat as a vegan without expectations dashed in a vegan outlet.You can get a lovely smoothie and a good salad to eat here. If you're vegan and expect something to satisfy your hunger, apart from pasta, tofu fish and chips/ burger, you're out of luck.It is what it is and for the masses it may be great, for foodie's it's deflating expectations."

It’s not unreasonable then to expect food/service that matches the premium charged.I only ordered an oat milk latte and a chocolate bun (it was far too small to be a cupcake) and was charged £7.20. The coffee would be a small size in any of the High Street chains. That’s really not good enough.Of greater concern was the quality. Vegan food has come on massively in the last few years. Not so at Chloe’s. The cake was dry and tasteless. It was reminiscent of vegan food from ten years ago. The coffee was lukewarm. I’d ordered a latte but was given a cappuccino portion (one third froth).Many vegans have environmental concerns close to their heart. I was genuinely astonished that Chloe’s uses single use cups and plates. Not only is it environmentally poor, it’s not what you expect when being charged £7.20 for a coffee and a cake. Service was poor too. A premium priced coffee shop should bring your order to you and not have you either waiting at the counter or give you a customer call device. Even McDonald’s will bring it to your table. This might be acceptable in low priced venues but not in expensive cafes.I won’t be back."

First impression: the line was incredibly long - in fact, the line was out the door. However, it moved quickly. The tables inside vary from small round ones accomodating two - three people to picnic sized tables accomodating 8 - 16 people. First come, first served with regard to table arrangements!By Chloe serves vegan food - the type of vegan food that is designed to approximate meat-based meals and sandwiches. Normally when searching for vegan choices, I try to opt for original vegan dishes. But By Chloe was close to our hotel and I had (by now) had enough of restaurant - attempts at serving vegan food (pasta with mixed vegetables, etc.) while dining with our business group.I ordered the taco salad while my husband ordered the Greek salad. Both were extremely generous in proportion and both extremely tasty. As at least one reviewer lamented, food is served in paper containers- a bit off-putting in terms of the cost of dining here as well as environmental concerns.I also ordered the toffee pudding while my husband enjoyed the smoothie of the day. My pudding was almost like a gingerbread cake with the gooey toffee in the middle. Anytime pudding is involved, I am 100% in!We enjoyed the substance of our meal and in fact returned the next evening to try different entrees, both of which were also delicious!The downsides: a bit pricey and as mentioned previously- the use of paper and plastic products."

I ordered the Pesto Meatball Sub and a Matcha, while my fiancé opted for the Mac n' Cheese and an Iced Latte. We went for the Air Baked Fries to share. The service here was great, the staff are very friendly and we were served quickly with only a short wait for our food to arrive. The sub was perfect. The Meatballs and Marinara paired perfectly with the Pesto and Cashew Cream, and the dense Potato Sub Roll worked excellently with all of the other textures on offer! Drinks were great, and the fries were nice (especially when dipped in the Chipotle Ailoli or Beet Ketchup!). The Mac N' Cheese, however, was a bit of a disappointment. Initially neither of us were impressed, particularly given other vegan offerings we’ve tried. And there was a pretty unpleasant after taste. On closer inspection the sauce alone is actually pretty tasty and quite cheesy. Leading me to believe the problem was with the (very starchy) pasta shells. I'm not sure if this is a one off bad batch, or the standard but it certainly wasn't to our taste and I wouldn't order it again. All in all, the setting is great, the venue is well decorated, in a suberb location, with excellent staff. The majority of our order was spot on, but the Mac N' Cheese was a let down. It’s not cheap, but I feel the pricing is pretty reasonable, especially considering the stones-throw distance from Covent Garden. Definitely worth a visit, even if the Mac n’ Cheese maybe isn’t worth ordering."

We were told it was a single kitchen - but that she would note our order and tell the chef. Once we'd ordered we noticed a disclaimer on the back of the menu that says essentially if your coeliac you eat at your own risk and should probably not done... This wasn't what we were told at the till.When our food arrived, it was so disappointing - missing ingredients/items and tiny side portions - I had a side of avocado - literally six 1cm cubes in a tiny pot - for £2!The food itself was bland, very little flavour.I had one of the breakfasts that listed spinach & walnuts as ingredients on the board & menu - there were none of either my plate.When we enquired after, the till server asked the manager - who pulled a face - in so much as why are they asking that - only to get the reply that the walnuts were in the patty....

Me and my boyfriend ordered the tempeh burger, pesto meatballs, mac n cheese and kale and artichoke dip. The burger patty was pathetic, burgers should be filling and satisfying, it was paper thin. The rest of the food was nice but nothing I would come back for. Lots of other reviews have mentioned great service...maybe we visited on a bad day, the people who served us didn’t even smile.

As a new vegan a decided to give this place a go and I'm so happy I did. By chloe offers so much good food that it is difficult to choose from I definitely have to go back to try all the other dishes. I decided to get the spicy thai kale salad. DOn't be fooled it is a salad but you won't feel like eating a salad at all. The whole thing is sprinkled with fried wontons and covered in a sticky sweet, spicy and salty sauce. (not the healthiest probably but sometimes you have to treat yourself, right ?) Make sure to try their drinks as well, I had the lemonade of the day it was pineapple i think and it was super delicious, not as sweet as a traditional lemonade which i enjoyed. They also offer complementary sauces like chipotle aioli and beetroot ketchup, make sure to try them both !The service was really good and quick. In terms of the prices, it is not the cheapest vegan food in London but for the whole experience it's worth it in my opinion. I payed like 12 pound for the salad and the lemonade so not that bad for being in the central London area."

While I don’t regret my selection, I do feel the meatball sub could have had more texture. The Mac and cheese was great though, as was the beet ketchup!However, the sweet potato fries were a little disappointing - soggy, as if they’d been reheated in their packaging. The atmosphere/decor seemed every stark and a little cheap. The fast food feel didn’t really match the mid-level/casual dining prices. Also, to echo others, although I recognise that veganism doesn’t have to go hand in hand with sustainability or environmentalism, there really were a lot of unnecessary disposable plastic items that made up the experience."

The restaurant is similar to a fast food place rather than a restaurant - and the atmosphere was pleasant and the staff were friendly.My wife had the classic burger with sweet potatoe fries and I had the guac burger with regular fries. At £13 each it was perhaps a little expensive but not particularly unexpected being a vegan restaurant in central London. Two drinks, a cookie and a cupcake for afters came to ~£42 all in. The food was good and tasted nice although I was expecting something...more. I wasn't disappointed and everything was good, but the only wow factor I got was from the chocolate chip and pecan cookie. A buggy park, or somewhere out of the way to leave it would have been a bonus too as it was a little cramped."

We have been twice already and plan to go there more, whenever we are in London. The first time we went they were still quite new and their where a few teething problems, but on our second visit it had all been sorted out. Perfect for vegans and also I can imagine non vegans eating perfectly happily here, it's so good to have an exclusively vegan place. It is a bit pricey but it is central London, so I can understand why, the portions always seem a bit small, and the quality of the food could be better, bit times I thought the chips where not cooked long enough and still felt a bit raw. The ""fish"" tofu is really nice too and my favourite dish, my husband likes the mac and cheeze - I may go for other items next time I visit. The cakes are all pretty great. it's a really nice atmosphere in their. They could also do more to be less wasteful, it's like a cross between a take out fast food place and sit down restaurant, the food comes presented in fast food style packaging but could some of this be less throw away?We will be back, many times I'm sure.

I had the kale caesar salad and the mac & cheese with a ginger & carrot juice and my partner (who isn't vegan) had the tofu fish and chips with a blueberry muffin to take away. We both enjoyed our meals - I was extremely impressed with the shiitake bacon! £10 for a salad and £5 for a juice is a bit pricey but I did expect it to be in that range. Once they take your order they provide you with a buzzer so you know when to go and collect your food. I would return and try the other salads if I ever got the chance.

And friendly service!,I’ve been here twice in a week since I discovered it it’s that good! And usually I don’t travel into town so that’s a sign. The food is amazing because it’s guilt free completely- I don’t need to worry about animals being harmed in the making of it and I can eat from the whole menu which is such a treat! It’s not the healthiest because it’s fast food but it’s so delicious so it’s worth it and if your going for the healthier option like the salad than you won’t be disappointed as it’s the more satisfying salad you would have ever had! Don’t get me started on the treats too! Service with a smile does not miss a trick here- really sweet and friendly staff. Well done by Chloe. I’ll be bringing all my friends! And trying out the rest of your menu- can’t wait!

I had the chickpea nicoise salad, large mac'n'cheese with shiitake bacon & a the best vegan cookie I've ever eaten. The total bill was £18 which is undeniably pricey, but I had been meaning to visit by CHLOE. for months, so I was happy to pay this as a one-off. Waited 15 minutes for the mac'n'cheese to be made, during peak time at 7pm. The staff are very helpful, you'll get a little tracker for when your order is ready, and the ambience of the restaurant is pretty cool. Vegans everywhere, just chatting about being vegan and how good the food looks, and the food does look good. The baked goods in the cabinet by the cashiers are just out of this world.The only criticism I have is that the cashier threw away the first chocolate chip cookie they selected for me, as it was put in a puddle of water...had they offered, I'd have happily saved the poor soggy cookie from the bin, and provided a warm belly for it to rest in... Probably wouldn't visit again as there's lots of similar (cheaper) vegan spots in other parts of London, but by CHLOE. is a good one to have on your radar, if you can afford it."

It had a tang of watermelon too which was super refreshing on a hot summers day. But the piece de resistance was the Mac and cheez. I knew I’d wanted to try it after seeing pictures all over insta but nothing prepared me for the mouth sensationthat it was! Such an incredible blend of flavours and textures.

Came on a Sunday. Parking a nightmare around the area.This is what we ordered :- 3 classic burgers with fries- fish and chips- macaroni cheese with fries.- 2 daily menu pancakes (strawberries, choc sauce etc)- 2 sticky toffee pudding- 1 muffins - 2 cupcakes.Bill came to approx £105. You have to go up to the counter and order. There is seating in a canteen type environment. Wooden disposable forks/knives/spoons etc.Staff very friendly and the place is clean. Toilets clean but not a lot of them.Now, this is where the let down was..... The food was not all it was hyped up to be (for us anyway). For a little over £100 I was expecting some kind of table service at least, and the food to be a bit better tasting than it actually was. It was not bad, but it was not great either or something to shout about. Chips were pretty much McDonalds with the same sort of packaging. Fish and Chips were good but the macaroni cheese was discusting (my daughter said). The muffin and cupcakes were OK but at approx £3.80 each we would not really go for them if we came here again. The pancakes were 50/50, not good and not bad either. The food does taste all fresh etc but just did not have that wow factor that I was expecting.I am sure a lot of people love this place, but it was not really for us because of the average taste of the food."

Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly member of staff. I explained it was my very first time visiting a vegan restaurant. She made some recommendations. I decided to order The Guac Burger and 50/50 fries (sweet potato and potatoes). The food was delicious! The atmosphere looked really nice and the decor was quite trendy. I decided to take a take out in the end as we couldn’t dine there as my colleague is allergic to nuts! The manager was very friendly and was very honest about possible cross contamination! Reason why I gave a 4 is because the waitress dealing with the orders gave my order to someone else and my order had to be remade! The manger was really nice and gave 2 free cookies!

The cookie was more or less as I remember at the U.S. locations. The sweet potato fries were actually the best I can remember having in a very long time, if not ever. The fish & chips was plain awful, the the chips were better than I expected, mainly due to the salt, if I'm honest. But the peas were too bland and the tofu was a huge, unseasoned and unmarinated block. The batter was decent enough, but thin that tofu hunk out by at least 1/3, marinate it in old bay spice or something, and try again. The shepherds pie wasn't bad, but the pie I had at Young Vegans later one blew this away.Also, the prices at by CHLOE., no matter which one you go to, are high compared to the competition. As a former (vegan) restaurant owner, I'm loathe to complain about prices. I want employees to be paid fairly and for the restaurant to stay open, but one gets the sense that these prices are padded out for profits. Now, some things seem fairly priced, but the sandwiches are over the top."

I mean when the place is empty please let diners enjoy and work if they’re working! And it’s not even that bad they’re quiet and nice I’ve seen worse in other restaurants, that’s one thing I absolutely can’t stand when they do this. I’ve recently visited another place where they were moving the chairs loudly, I’ll never go back to this other place! So don’t try to appear busy please if the empty tables next to the one busy table look perfect don’t come and play with it . I think the two times I went there and it was empty they’ve done that four times in the whole hour I was sitting there. Another thing is they have separate cashiers for credit card and cash so they should just ask the customer BEFORE they explained their order how they want to pay! It would save everyone time and effort! I went back there the WiFi wasn’t working and the avocado in my Kale Caesar salad was rock hard :( luckily the nice server offered to give me extra shiitake bacon free of charge as all the avocados were hard.i really appreciate this! All the staff is actually really nice and polite much more than in New York so that’s a plus :) not to mention that they never give you anything to compensate if you’re dissatisfied with your food in NYC Nothing is given away for free even for regular customers. So London hats off! Food wise I tried the fish and chips, te chips, tartar sauce and all are really good but I was disappointed with the “tofu fish”. Also tried the shepherds pie it was good but I really have nothing to compare it to as I don’t ever think I’ve had it in my life before. The fresh coconuts were very high quality. I really like that this location is less crowded than NYC and let’s say it feel “civilized “ they have buzzers so they don’t scream peoples names when the food arrives, there isn’t hoards of people trying to steel your seat or just being plain loud! So overall there’s room for improvement but good experience."

This is a bit like a vegan FiveGuys where you pay restaurant prices for what is essentially fast food. A very simple burger is £9 and it doesn't come with anything. The kale salad, also £9, was rather good actually. The theme/style is a bit confusing - glitzy Las Vegas vibe doesn't really chime with the down to earth nature of vegan food, and by looking at the clientele it didn't seem like anyone knew or cared that it was a vegan restaurant. Maybe they could make the burger £7 even if it meant employing one less person. Much prefer Temple of Seitan which does reasonable priced vegan fast food"

I think they could price it down a bit considering it is basically just pre-prepared vegan junk food, much of which you could do at home if you wanted.It's a bit of a weird system in that the seating is a free for all, no reservations, obviously to get more people in there than can actually fit, which reminds me of a McDonalds or something similar, so I wouldn't plan on dining in at peak times."

The seating was utterly shambolic - no system whatsoever for getting a table, and you had to hover waiting for people to leave. Why not operate a queueing system organised by a host like most restaurants do? By Chloe charges table service prices with a McDonald’s approach to seating :(I also found that the staff are very unwelcoming to people with nut allergies, which seems to be a common problem after reading some of the other reviews. I have had allergies all my life and completely understand it when restaurants warn me that their kitchens use nuts and they can’t guarantee their food is nut free. However, By Chloe’s attitude is “don’t come here if you can’t have nuts”, which is ridiculous and a very poor attitude, given that they offer plenty of nut-free options.Finally, I was very shocked to see all the disposable cutlery, plates, and cups. For a vegan, supposedly environmentally friendly, restaurant this is completely unacceptable. I realise they are compostable, but re-usable cutlery and plates would be much better for people eating in.So overall, good food, but not a great experience, and there are much better veggie places in London. Try nearby(ish) Tibits or Mildred’s for excellent vegan food, a welcoming attitude to people with allergies, a functional seating system, and environmentally friendly crockery!"

So I ordered fish and chips at £7.80.The chips were great and so were the mushy peas. And I’m not a big fan of mushy peas but these were beautiful. The fish is a large piece of deep fried tofu covered in seaweed and batter. Good for tofu lovers.The portion was also a decent size and I found the food extremely filling. I had to take away my leftovers. I wasn’t going to eat them. The Iced Tea was not sweet at all. Just how I like it. But there is agave syrup on the side if you want to sweeten it.The fish and chips were great value for money so I do recommend them. Other dishes are pricey but to be honest I haven’t tried them so they could be worth it. I personally think the Iced Tea was slightly overpriced at £2.75.

With the ordering at the counter / no seating system my friends had already placed their food orders and sat down so I had to either go through the hassle of asking them all to cancel their orders and find another vegan friendly restaurant nearby or the manager eventually said that if I took full responsibility (and liability) I could look at the allergen menu and order.

It's a lovely vegan diner and the menu is extensive. I had the mac and cheese which was just so lovely I will have it again next time minus the smoky bacon flavour mushrooms - don't get me wrong, these are a perfect topping for anyone who is craving the taste of 'bacon' but just not for me. I agree with others on here in that prices are a bit steep, considering there is no 'service' as such. Also, the use of disposable cutlery and serving dishes was a bit worrying, I hope it definitely is all recycled. Maybe because it was a hot weekend, staff were not rude or anything, just a tad slow for a 'fast food' diner type place. That said, we all loved the fab menu and the tasty food - and will be back for sure."

If you are tired of having to suffer less than pleasant surroundings for your veganism this might be for you. The restaurant has a American diner type of feel to it with friendly staff dressed in baseball caps. However it has a classy feel with plenty of well spaced seating and the food is good. There are some great UK twists to the menu and the Fish n Chips has to tried at least once. This was a revelation with a clever use of nori, firm tofu and a special batter. This is not a cheap place to eat and some of the portions are not over generous but well worth a visit. The Kale Caesar was excellent with a great balance of tastes and we also tried the Pesto Meatball sub which although lacking the texture of meatball had some lovely tangy taste from the pesto, sauce and cashew mayo. The selection of cakes and ice cream is very good and well worth popping in for even if you don’t fancy a full meal Those expecting a cheap meal will be disappointed as this is not a cheap eating establishment. Drinks are also expensive and there is no alcohol . Light lunch for four people cost over £50 and drinks range from £3-£6. Having said that the water is free and there is no sneaky service change. You order and pay at the counter, find your own seat and then the electronic buzzer given to you at the counter flashes and vibrates when the food is ready to collect. The food arrives really quickly but there is not rush to more you on as one finds in other places. There is a take away service too that seems very popular. I do agree about the disposable implements reuse would be a better option for the nevironment."

There are clearly not enough tables to meet the demand of all the hipster vegans in town. This place brings out the worst hidden human traits - shoving, yelling, pushing, possessiveness. We waited so long for a table that we had to eat our food standing up - not something you want to be doing when you’re 61 years old. At no point were we apologised to or advised to go somewhere else. It might be a vegan place but people behave like they’re on the hunt for a wild boar. Awful place, save yourself some anxiety and stay at home."
Why the disposable cutlery?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d13473946-r577120809-By_CHLOE-London_England.html,My husband and I ate here before going to the theatre and I was very excited about the menu options as a new vegan.

I had the fish and chips which was very nice although the mushy peas could have been mushier. My husband had the classic burger and fries which he said was OK....he's a carnivore so he'd prefer beef. I do think it's quite pricy when you consider vegetables are much cheaper than meat. There's no way a burger containing chick peas, herbs and spices should be the same price as a beef burger. It's a pity the cutlery is disposable as I'd prefer proper cutlery because it's better for the environment and gives a better dining experience. Also, considering they don't provide table service, I think the prices are way too high."

I had the fish and chips, a chocolate chip cookie and an Americano. The chips were lovely, as was the white dip that came with them. The fish wasn’t really to my taste and the coffee was horrible (very watery and tasteless). The cookie however was brilliant, one of the best I’ve had. So overall the food was decent. The only thing that didn’t quite sit right with me was the amount of plastic used. As a vegan I try my best to do the least possible harm to the environment, so visiting here and having to use plastic cups and sauce, wooden cutlery, and a card tray seemed very unnecessary when I was eating in. Even the plants on the walls were plastic. I understand that the materials used were recyclable but surely washable cutlery and plates would be better for the environment?"

It was tasty and l enjoyed the pickles and nut 'cheese' that was on top as it made a nice change from standard avo on toast. I was also impressed by the banana and walnut bread which was pretty delicious and the portion size was very generous.However, the cost of just one slice was £8.40 which l think is way too expensive, even for such a central and touristy part of London. I really can't see how this is justified. My fellow diners chose the salad which they enjoyed, which was just a shade under £10, again too expensive for what it is.Whilst it's great to see new and innovative vegan places opening up, l think the pricing needs to be looked at if this place is going to survive for the longer term."

There’s something on this menu for everybody.It’s very tasty and more importantly it mimics the textures and flavours of meaty-inspired dishes to a T.We tried the following dishes:Mac n’ Cheese (with sweet potato-cashew cheese sauce, shiitake mushroom bacon, almond shavings)The Classic Burger (with tempeh-lentil-chia-walnut patty, pickles, onions, beet ketchup and special sauce on a potato bun)The Guac Burger (with black bean-quinoa-sweet potato patty, corn salsa, onions, guac, tortilla strips, and chipotle aioli special on a whole grain bun)The Pesto Meatballs (with portobello and veggie meatballs, marinara, sweet peppers, basil pesto, cashew mozz, almond shavings on a potato sub roll)Air Baked Fries (sweet potato and originals)The Daily Pancake (with whipped maple butter)The baked goods are also delicious. Do consider bagging some for the walk or ride home.Walk-ins are possible but bear in mind that it’s a popular spot and that its a free for all regarding seating.

We'd love to come back for the brunch, but on our first visit today we enjoyed a dinner of 'fish' and chips with a side of totrilla chips and out-of-this-world kale artichoke almond-parm dip.The fish was delightful, with the perfect ratio of 'meat' to batter and a flavour-enhancing skin of seaweed to really boost the faux fish. The tartar sauce was lemony, salty, and vinegary - with wee chunks, as it should have. Chips are chunky and well seasoned. The whole presentation was very crisp.You get unlimited access to the chipotle aioli and beetrot ketchup, which are both fantastic, and excellent signature accompaniments to the chips.Looking forward to coming again."

I have actually been her about 3 times now and I can totally understand why the other reviewers have been frustrated with queuing & lack of table space. I think that This is because it’s a new popular place. I first went on a Friday evening & we had to wait over 20 mins for a table. However, once we had our table and got our food it was delicious. We had different burgers, Guac and a regular one with sweet potato chips, both were very tasty. The beetroot dip was lovely too. I had a chocolate cupcake which was dry but still tasty. I’ve been again and had ‘fish and chips’ (tofu) which was unfortunately very bland but the accompanying chips (they were like proper British chips) and peas were delicious. It is expensive but I found the service great, friendly and quick. The toilets were also clean and spacious. Expect to queue if you go but in my opinion it’s worth it.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d13473946-r572689729-By_CHLOE-London_England.html#"

Possibly a little over-priced given the fast-food set up, and particularly so if you decide to take away. It was also quite a shame that so much packaging was used, even if you ate in.I think this place needs to decide if it’s more of a restaurant (sort out how you seat people and cut the excess packaging) or if it’s more of a fast food take away (reduce the price a bit) but regardless the food was faultless!"

Temptation is everywhere I look, especially on my phone - single serving dopamine hits are drawn together on my newsfeed, entertaining the masses but feeding me knowledge of my next meal.The visual imagery expressed by “by Chloe” sent my brain into over-drive from the start. How has this American vegan junk food brand found their way onto my newsfeed?I’m addicted. Every post makes me hungrier, and instantly want to be a part of Chloe’s gang. The colours like a kaleidoscopic dilated my pupils more than a Sunday night in Glastonbury. I was hooked on the branding without even tasting a bite. Finally, after not too much delay I made it to their first site in London, Covent Garden. As soon as you walk in you realise that THIS is the future. Faster than fast casual. A new breed of junk food - by Chloe had landed, and skidded into my heart in style. The Fonz style, no, Tarantino style - trigger fingers shot from the hip. Bang. Bang. She shot me down, bang bang. The Guac burger was utterly delicious and made me question how other burger joint will evolve to compete - the pesto ‘meatball’ sub with a potato bun was, and I want to swear - it was like Sex. Great sex. Like sex with the ex after you’ve had a personal trainer for 6 months. I felt nourished, healthy and a little bit smug. I need more, the temptation to return is all encompassing. I want more By Chloe sites on my doorstep - if I could eat like this forever I would. I cannot wait to see what the future entails for this brand - and whether the provinces out of london will Love the food as much as I did. I hope they do, they should... I recommend it to all. You won’t regret a bite."

I went mid week around 6pm and it was BUSY, I can only imagine the weekends would be mayhem but here is my experience:• I was greeted by a smiley young man who gave me a menu and took me to a seat. • I read the menu and ordered at the bar, i was given one of those little buzzer jobs to let me know when my meal was ready. I only waited 5 mins on it buzzing. • burgers and sandwiches are around £9 and sides £3-£5• the cutlery is all eco compostable ‘plastic’ • my food was delicious. I am not a picky vegan, and I’ve had my fair share of questionable vegan dishes, but this tasted dirty good! I’m going back for more!• by the time I left there were people standing with their food waiting on a table. I would suggest waiting to get a table before ordering if you go when it’s busy. • the staff floating round clearing tables and directing people to their seats were super efficient and very smiley. What could be better:• I was still eating and someone asked if they could clear my tray away. Chill out - I know there is a queue but I’ve paid and I’m eating. • the servers at the till looked like they’d just pulled a 16 hour shift. Remember you’re facing the public and you are the face of this company. Eye contact and a smile wouldn’t go amiss. All in all I had an excellent time and really enjoyed my food and the vibe. I can forgive the little ‘annoyances’ because sometimes people have rough days. Defo try it! I would love one of these in my home town - bring some f your vegan love to Glasgow By Chloe there are tonnes of us here!!"

It was a little snug but we wanted to have a quick bite before a theatre show so didn't mind. You order as with fast food chains they give you a beeper which will let you know when your food is ready. We ordered some pasta dishes, a salad and a cupcake. All vegan (as per the restaurant design) and absolutely delicious. Even their dipping sauces were quite interesting like beet ketchip. The food came really quick and was piping hot which was great. The cupcake was a raspberry tiramisu which is to die for! Everyone there was super friendly and great customer service. I will definitely be coming back to try more on the menu! The vegan fish and chips look quite intriguing!"

You had to queue for a table and when you managed to get one you felt harassed by the ever lengthening queue with people eyeing up your table. You have to go up to the counter and order then wait for you to be buzzed on your buzzer which also makes you feel a bit unrelaxed. Plastic cutlery, poor quality napkins. food served in paper and a tin. I know its meant to be edgy fast food but honestly serious waste of time. Food wasn't that great. nice but by the time you have added all the extras, your 'fast food' quick bite is the same price as a meal in another restaurant. Portions also weren't that big (tiny little bag of chips! Burger to be fair was ok size but not ginormous)."

Which is about the only good thing about our visit. I got my fries but then had to wait an extra 5 minutes awkwardly at the counter waiting for my drinks whilst the fries went cold. My matcha latte was cold when I received it and I noticed the lady prepared the matcha after steaming the milk which probably didn’t help. I asked if I could get a new one and the lady reluctantly agreed as though I had insulted her... it’s not that difficult to make another drink or even steam it a little more. A lot of the staff seemed to be untrained and not really know what they were doing. My partners latte wasn’t exactly steaming hot but it was bearable. However it was super foamy! Like all foam! And the cup wasn’t even full. Vegan coffee isn’t that hard to get right, even when using alternative milks like oat milk it can still be a good barista style coffee. I was disappointed the amount of paper and plastic waste around the place, plastic cups for eat in coffee, paper on the trays, plastic cutlery, colouring paper?! And even plastic pots for eat in sauces. It was just a little baffling for a vegan place to have such a disregard. All in all I left feeling disappointed. And £10+ for 2 coffees and a cup of fries seemed steep. I wish they would spend more time training the staff and making an effort to be environmentally friendly (being a vegan place I would expect this, I mean why would you care so much about animals but then ruin the world they have to live in?!) than they have spent time on the look and graphic design of the place.Seems to be capitalising on the vegan food “trend”."

A BLT and a juice was over £10 - for an extra pound I can get a main, two sides and a glass of wine at Farmstand, for instance. You're paying for staff to stand around handing out paper menus (seriously!!) to the clientele when, given the wait time in the queue was around ten minutes, they'd have been better employed behind the counter. Less wastage too - which leads me to...sandwiches are plastic wrapped; juice is in plastic bottles; there is an awful lot of environmental unfriendliness going on. Won't bother going back."

The restaurant is easy to find a few minutes walk from Holborn underground, and the inside is so chic. I had the fish and chips, small mac and cheese and a dessert cookie. All of it was so delicious. With some vegan meals like mac and cheese, it can often be dull and tasteless and it can be hard to even get bacon sometimes as a vegan, however by CHLOE did not miss the mark. All the food was delicious and not everyone (including myself) often follow a vegan diet. Anyone could visit here and enjoy the food! Friendly staff as well. Bear in mind that this restaurant is not table service. Make sure you get a table before you order or you may have a tray of food and nowhere to sit."

I ordered the Morning Glory burger for £9.. it came on a tray along with my boyfriends so pretty difficult to eat as it has a sloppy tofu filling. The burger did taste delicious but for £9 it could at least have a side of hash browns or something? £9 is pretty pricey to digest within 5 mins. If you're going to be a fast food chain the price needs to lower, or serve it on a plate so customers can take their time eating it. Oat flat whites were pretty foamy which was disappointing as literally everywhere provides a good barista coffee. Being vegan a little disappointed with plastic/paper cup too, seems a bit ignorant. All that aside the burger was very tasty and if you want an LA vibe in London it's not bad."

We went to order at the bar and our food was ready within 10 minutes. They called our names and came over with our food so we didn’t have to actually wait at the counter to collect.I was a bit disappointed that my chosen juice wasn’t available but there were a few others to choose from; to be frank I would have preferred a nice G&T or glass of wine with my meal but no such luck! We both had the classic burger and potato fries. We had the beetroot ketchup and chipotle sauce from the sauce pumps too. We both enjoyed our burgers and the fries were decent. The sauces were very tasty. My two food items and my drink cost about £19 so this is not a cheap place considering it’s counter service junk food so I wouldn’t come here regularly. There is one proper pudding - sticky toffee pudding with coconut custard.However I can’t tell you how that was as they had sold out. A bit rubbish considering it was only 7.30pm at this point and it’s their only proper dessert (I exclude ice lollies and cupcakes).I didn’t actually pay much attention to the decor and my immediate dining neighbours didn’t seem to fall into the much mentioned nauseating instagrammer/blogger brigade but I observed a few on the way out pouting over their guac burgers and kale salads.Overall I don’t think it’s nearly as bad as many of the previous reviews on TA but it’s also not nearly as good as some of the other over the top gushing reviews. It’s just somewhere in the middle. If it’s in your budget then it’s worth a try whether you are vegan or not. Be prepared to wait for a table, leave your scepticism (and your selfie stick..) at the door, enjoy your meal and then head to the pub on the corner for that G&T!"

Well then you have to eat it. And it is not good. I've been a chef for so many years, in a variety of Restaurants- including, yes, Michelin starred ones, and I know how food should taste. And how food should not taste. It should not taste like this. Usually when food is bad, I try to forget about it. I erase from my mind so I don't have to relive the mild displeasure. But the horror here is so strong I've been forced to write this review in the hope that it will steer someone away from the wrong path, and lead them to choosing something else. Anything else. Everything we ordered was a lukewarm, unseasoned mess. It tasted of nothing. And yet, so much worse than nothing. Because nothing isn't offensive. The sweet potato fries were limp and sad, wilting to the touch. The Mac and cheese was NEITHER OF THOSE TWO THINGS. My god how did it pass various tastings? Who thought it could possibly pass as something edible? And the salads were not offensive, just dull and massively overpriced. It doesn't surprise me that when you Google By Chloe, London. TripAdvisor is so far down the first page, that various other links to reviews by lifestyle bloggers and paid content sites sits above it. Im sure you do want to hide just how awful the food is here. If you too want to be under thirty, live in athleisure, and live gluten free even though you're not quite sure what gluten is, plus wanna take a neon snap for the gram then maybe you'll like it here.But if you're a real diner spending real money; spend it somewhere else."

There was a lot of plastic used and whilst some was clearly biodegradable, some clearly was not. It is expensive, but it is in Covent Garden. Service is very fast. I had a flat white which was just too large and not enough coffee, but I accept this is probably down to my taste. Slightly disappointed.

On arrival we were greeted by a smiley and helpful member of staff. He really did his best in squeezing 3 of us into the very limited seating. A bit of a case of style over substance - although I recognise that decision is made by interior designers and not the people in the restaurant! Unfortunately his colleagues weren’t so helpful. The ordering system and counter staff is really where this place falls down. I have no problem with ordering and waiting at the counter, but the system is slow (made slower by asking for email addresses to send receipts to, which is silly because they also print paper receipts for you to collect your order with) and the worst part is the sound of bored staff announcing that food is ready by yelling customers’ names. It’s a small restaurant that gets very noisy, so they simply can’t be heard. The crowd around the counter really grew quickly and started to block the door. People sat down out of boredom and then missed their names being called.There also seemed to be no rationale for how quickly people got food. I waited 20 minutes for my burger and the woman next to me waiting longer for her salad, while people behind us in the queue walked away with the same dishes in 5-10 minutes. The disinterested girls behind the counter had no idea how to deal with complaints about this. The manager was professional to the last and I did feel sorry for him as he tried to co-ordinate his churlish and chaotic team. He did notice me quietly waiting and went off to find my burger - at last, decent service!The food was tasty, the portions sizes decent and the menu varied, but the ‘service’ really does put me off going back.In short - improve staff on the counter, get a number system for orders and squeeze in a few more benches."

All i have been hearing about since December is the arrival of ""By Chloe"" in London! massive PR machine behind this US born chain! Instagram ""celebrities"" and bloggers all posting the awesome photos of the food and the venue as it opened last month! I am always reluctant to follow trends but my other half was keen to check it out so we did! What a downer! And for very clear reasons! 1. The ambiance is great, it has a diner style that makes the place a little posher than a fast food chain would be! Tables are on the right and left side of the main counter where payments and take away can be made! It is all self serving (choose food, order and pay at counter, like mc donald's pretty much! the only thing here, here you pay £9 for a burger and extra for fries (especially if you want the air ""fried ones""2. Fight to be seated: So, in true fast food style, the tables are randomly for grabs. The staff cannot help or reserve a table for you! ""It is not a restaurant"" they said! So here two important things: 1. if i pay £9 for a dish, no matter how ""fast food "" like you are, then i want to not stress people eating by hovering over their shoulders whilst they attempt to enjoy their food and 2. I don't want people hovering all over mine when i eat my food! It is uncomfortable and i could have gone to a fast food chain and pay 50p for a burger! 3. The food is glamourised Junk, but healthier that your standard fast food place and of course plant based, which is why we went thereto try it. I had the pesto ""meatballs"" sub and although it had a nice flavour, it made me feel awful. i woke up feeling terrible too! most probably because i am so used to eating high quality food and the sub was super processed, my body is in shock! So, not really as wholesome as i would have had it. the fries were too salty, and only the top were crispy; the bottom was super soggy! 4. 2 burgers, 2 frieds, 1 kombucha, 1 water, 1 coconut water, 1 cupcake and treats for our dog came to £60! The place makes Farmacy look like a bargain! I cannot justify the price for this kind of food and atmosphere so def not a place to return to. i get that the rest must be super high in Covent Garden but well.. For £30pp i have amazing meals at Redemption, and i mean amazing! 5. PLASTIC PLASTIC AND MORE PLASTIC: WHAT is up with that?!?! 2018: a bunch of eco friendly choices for cutlery are available! Why the plastic cutlery and straws? Why? for the price these guys charge they could spend a little more and get biodegradable utensils! On the plus side they have GLASS water bottles. They go through tons of paper on their treys, is that necessary? i don't believe so, they could have treys that are printed to loo funky and then clean they as they go, reducing the amount of rubbish they produce. They have way too many people going through those doors not to make a negative impact on the environment, even if they recycle! So overall, this experience was not great for me personally. I am way too advanced in the food and health business to being able to enjoy food that is mass produced, lacks love and is not worth the money , i don't care how bad inflation (or currency deflation) is! I don't enjoy writing bad reviews , but it lacks zing!"

If this is just being vegan for the sake of trendiness, then it holds no interest for me. How do animals benefit with even more plastic clogging up their habitats. This is a pricey place with young inexperienced staff. Surely some of the profits could be invested into decent washable crockery and cutlery for people dining in. I saw people drinking their green juices from plastic cups with straws. It's a shame, but I won't be making a second visit."

Although when we eventually got our food it did taste excellent, the service was poor. You cannot book a table so we were left standing for some time before being able to find a seat. We ordered our food at the same time but unfortunately the salad I ordered took 15 minutes or so longer to arrive than the other food. You have to stand at the bar and wait for your food to come so by the time my food was ready I had missed most of the lunch. My colleague was given the wrong food order which had to be changed. Basically, if you are pushed for time 1 hour lunch during work I wouldn't advise to come here. Otherwise the food did taste really nice."

But there is a big issue.. I visited Chloe's in New York last year and was really impressed. Since then I've been excitedly posting online, and spreading the word in support of you expanding to my hometown of London. I planned a trip to Chloe's a few days ago, bringing all my family, keen to show them the Veggie revolution! When I arrived I asked for the allergen menu, and was instantly faced with very scared staff faces. My brother has a peanut allergy, and never has he felt so excluded, the manager (though I understand it's not his fault) said that the head office had told him not to serve anyone with a nut allergy. The other staff were looking aghast at my brother, telling stories of people that had had nut reactions in the restaurant already!Now I understand that a lot of Chloe's dishes have nuts in them, but I often visit Thai restaurants, and others that use nuts, but they are understanding and agree to use separate utensils and just take extra care.. Never, have we been told we can't eat somewhere, and had to leave. My brother is trying to be a Vegan, and of course there are times when the nut allergy is an issue, but he isn't the only Vegan with a nut allergy, and if anything his step into Veganism should be enocouraged, not by being excluded from restaurants such as yours! I felt very embarrassed about having to lead my family out of the restaurant, with a brother who felt very guilty, as though it were his fault in some way. I seriously think you need to address this, and make it possible for people with allergies to dine there.Veganism is all about being 'picky' and going that extra mile with food, being healthier, and pushing the boundaries with ingredients; but that is not being considered when it comes to diners allergies."

Unfortunately the experience was ruined by their brainless (dis)organisation!By Chloe tries to pass the concept they are an easygoing gals bunch and you can just grab some food at the counter and sit where you want, in their amazingly shabbily chichly decorated space.Well they were not prepared for the London reality: yes we can form an organised queue in London and yes we get the concept of fast food, but if you don't have the number of tables a fast food has well you should just get more organised! Just throwing a couple of ideas: 1) take reservations or 2) more simply take orders at the tableHaving people queue to order and THEN find a table is simply impractical because there is a bunch of other people who do the exact opposite and block a table before joining the queue to order, thus occupying a table for likely twice the time (the queue to order food is long and the wait time for the burgers is even longer). Moreover this small place gets crowded pretty quickly so once you do get a table you will eat with people's bags and jackets in your face, that's pretty much guaranteedComing to the food, well the food is NOT worth the hassle or the wait. Come here for the pics of the pink neons (nice!) or to feel a young health-conscious girl (boys will just be dragged here, can't imagine any willingly entering anyway) but do not come here for the food. We tried the guac burger, the classing burger and the pesto meatballs, the former is ok if you manage to finish it quickly enough, before the patty gets soggy, the latter is simply not worth the energy of chewing it. The sweet potato fries were nice of course, but it's quite hard to get that wrongWe could not bear another queue to order the dessert so we just left and went home for a vegan home made dessert. Sorry by Chloe, you won't see me again!"

Two of us shared the meatball sub, large mac&cheese and a portion of fries - perfect for lunch but we’d have wanted more if it was dinner. The mushroom ‘bacon’ on the mac&cheese was brilliant and I’d recommend you order extra! Meatball sub was the star of the menu for sure! Oh and make sure you try the beetroot ketchup and other dip - they’re amazing.

The food was uninspiring - better and tastier is available at most local vegan enterprises, staff seemed a bit lost and most items are terribly overpriced (small wilted Cesar salad in a plastic container £9.50??) even for Covent Garden. But the absolute glaringly irritating element is the sea of plastic everywhere: disposable cutlery, drinking cups, take away containers....there is a nod to sustainability: recyclable serving plates...the trash containers outnumber recycling points 2:1. And the staff happily tips each used tray into trash.Personally, I am vegan for the animals and happily welcome all kind of comfort food eateries and I am sure food and personnel can be sorted out. The really worrying thing here is that by CHLOE seem to want to surf the vegan moment without really having thought what it is all about and by doing so risk devaluing the whole thing. You can just see people thinking : faddy overpriced food literally costing the Earth.Please prove me wrong."

My favourite is always the kale salad and artichoke dip. Always go for a cookie - banana bread is just amaaaazing. A salad plus artichoke dip plus a cookie can set you back £18.

What does the host do except hand out menus and tell people to do everything themselves?Ill put up with queues and teething problems in a new vegan place, but this chain is established and gives off a bad attitude. We walked straight back out."

When we arrived there were two queues, one to buy food and one to get tables but there was no order to the queue for tables so people were pushing in and arguing. Some people had already got food but had nowhere to sit so were forced to eat standing up and hovering around tables whereas others had secured a table but then had to leave their belongings to get in the food queue meaning it took ages to actually eat their meal. It was quite stressful! They ran out of some of the drinks on the menu despite being very early and the food was cold and quite expensive in terms of portion size."

Its fast casual so not fussy but the prices are reasonable and the space itself is very comfortable.

Verdict.. i enjoyed the (walnut) burger my little 8 year old didn't ..Mac and Cheese was wolfed down but Beetroot ketchup was a massive thumbs down with the chips. Its unfair for me to give the food avarage as its not my bag, but the restaurant was chaos with not enough seats due to far too many 'silly' swinging seats and lounge areas and the service was slow which caused a big mass of people queuing next to our table with lots of people getting stressed by the wait hmmm"

Absolutely, it's decked out to impress any blogger, trendsetter or plant based enthusiasts. As you enter the front door you begin to wonder how this all works. I immediately saw a girl dangling a receipt in her hand, which made me think she was a host or receptionist, so I asked her if we could get a table, but silly me, it soon became apparent that she was part of a larger group of foodies waiting for their orders to be called out. Meanwhile, a long line of new arrivals queued to place an order at the counter. It was soon apparent that there were no floor staff or hosts to show you to a table and if you wanted to order, you'd need to join the line. As you join the line you realise that you need to find a table and a menu, so my wife looked for a table as I browser over the menu whilst queueing. The staff were friendly, but obviously they were still adjusting to the new opening. I placed my order at the register (classic burger, kale caesar salad, fries, 2 cookies, bottle of still water and a flat white - around £33) and was asked my name. The ordering system was slightly confusing and felt a bit like you were buying something from Argos, but slightly more personalised. I waited with the rest of the crowd for about 20min as my wife waited at the table. I did ask one of the servers behind the counter to delay my coffee until later, but it was already sitting on the service tray waiting for me behind the counter. The server told me that they'd already made the coffee, which seemed like an odd thing to prepare first, so I replied ""ok, I'll have it now then"", but by this time the coffee had been standing too long and was already cold, while the rest of my order hadn't been made yet. I informed the server that the coffee was cold, which they were happy to replace when I was ready for it. After waiting about 20min, all I had received were 2 cookies. They finally called out my name and slid a tray towards me with the Kale Caesar salad, classic burger on the small side & fries. The classic burger and fries were slightly cold, but we really enjoyed the flavour of the Kale Caesar salad. I returned to the counter to collect my coffee and bottle of water, which had been forgotten. Overall, the service was very disappointing, our food took a very long time and the burger/fries were cold - which made me think it was over priced for what you received for your money. On the other hand the venue looks great, it's a bloggers paradise and it's got a name behind it, but the quality of food and service could be so much better. Standing around for about 20min waiting for your order to be called out isn't great. It would be much better if you had proper table service and a receptionist to inform you about the ordering system. It's just too unorganised and you expect more, especially when there are so many other quality plant based/vegan restaurants around with faster, streamlined service at competitive prices."

I had a pesto meatball together with a seasonal lemonade and kale and artichoke dip with tortillas.The pesto meatball was delicious, as good as NYC and it stayed warm whilst I ate it. The lemonade was nice, however I would ask for less ice next time. The kale and artichoke dip was not as nice as there was far too much black pepper in it which overwhelmed the flavour.The service was good - you have to wait so you can tell the food is freshly prepared. However with a lot of people waiting for orders it is hard sometimes for staff to marry up the food with the customer. They can take your email address to let you know when your food is ready - I have my email and got an email receipt but not an email to say when it was ready but that may be because I was waiting near the counter so saw when my food came out.Based on the visit I will definitely return but It would be nice if there are improvements over the next few weeks."

Loved the pink neon sign, saying ‘Guac save the Queen’.Lots of would-be customers hovering by the door and around the packed restaurant, waiting for tables to vacate. No indication of what the system is, just staff behind the counter asking “who’s next?” to order. A door person could easily solve this and avoid some of the ‘will I get a table without getting in someone’s way’ anxiety. I found a table after about a five minute wait and ordered my food - Guac Burger and ‘Air dried’ fries, £13.00 total. The lady took my name and said someone would call me. I wondered why there was no buzzer system or table number requested. I tried to tell her where in the restaurant I would be sitting but there was no way to make a note of this. After 5 minutes or so I noticed a staff member wandering around the restaurant, gently calling my name. She showed me the ticket to confirm that was what I’d ordered and I pushed back through the next lot of hovering customers to the counter where my food was sitting, patiently waiting for me. By the time I got some beet ketchup and chipotle aioli (both delicious) and got back to my table, the chips were lukewarm and the black bean and quinoa burger patty was less than tepid with what disappointingly tasted like a stale (un toasted) burger bun. I wondered what the kitchen set up was and how long the burger had sat on top of the bun before the lettuce leaves, red onion, avo and sweet corn (all very fresh, tasty and fridge cold) were put on top of it, and then how long the tray had sat on the side before someone picked it up and sat it on the counter top (not heated) while the sweet - but possibly too gentle - staff member wandered round looking for someone called Anna. I heard the people next to me discussing that they’d get an email when their food was ready but I hadn’t been given that option. I wondered if I should have waited by the counter but I would have been in the way and possibly lost my seat. I wondered if we were all a bit too British for this style of service which may work better with loud American voices and people unafraid of asking for a seat. I didn’t enjoy my burger because it was just too cold and the bread tasted past it’s best. (You know when you take a bite and it’s a bit white...? I don’t have a better way to describe it). I don’t think it was supposed to be served cold but I could be wrong there. The chips were tasty and if they’d been hot, would have been delicious with the two dips. I looked around for someone who might like feedback but the staff were all exceptionally young and tentative. I’m sure these are just teething problems which can be easily sorted and hope when I return in a few months, the system will be better organised and if it’s quieter, I hope the food will be hot. At the moment, @bigvlondon still holds the burger crown."

This place was absolutely rammed both days I visited (Friday and Saturday lunch time) and rightfully so. The menu offers dishes from pancakes and scrambled tofu to hot dogs and burgers. The first day wasn’t perfect; my burger and fries were both cold. But the second day my food (quinoa salad bowl) was much better. One thing I will note is that the allergens aren’t obvious. I ordered what was advertised as a “classic chocolate chip cookie” but the receipt stated that there were pecans in it. I wouldn’t have thought twice about it, but those with nut allergies would be at risk here. That is, however, the only remotely negative thing I’d have to say. In all, this place is doing a great thing, the staff are hardworking and friendly and I’m glad to have so many options for all 3 meals. Would recommend."

But still tasty and well done. We also tried the ""meatballs"" sandwich, delicious! And the air baked potatoes are a nice alternative but their French fries is better.We had food envy with other people as everything looked amazing. The mac n cheese was also excellent, really surprising.The only thing that doesn't work well is the table system. You can't reserve and you need to order at the counter and your own table to it's a big mess with people walking around and stalking tables waiting for people to finish, very frustrating.Finally, the staff is lovely and welcoming. The portions are great but prices are a bit high."
