The concept is great. Pick your food, weigh it at the counter, pay, repeat until full. The one plate was enough for me and it was affordable too at 9.50; I am a big eater too and this was suffice. The food was outstanding. Everything I tried had amazing flavours. The falafel was excellent. Tofu even better. Paella, Indian Dahl and rice all very good. No comment on service as you order drinks and pay at the bar. Was lovely to be able to sit outside in the sun though. Quick or slow to suit your needs, this was an ideal lunch setting. I'll be back and next time it will be for breakfast."

And then end up spending 30 pounds for a plate of vegetables, a glass of wine and a tiny piece of desert: a rip off.  With that price in London you can go in many restaurants, sit down, have great food and wine and enjoy your night. Tibits is just going to be a waist of your Time and money."

There are tables inside and out, and we sat on the latter, as it was a lovely day. The restaurant is set up as a buffet, where one chooses one's dishes, and then one pays depending on weight. The food is wholesome, relatively simple fare, but quite delicious. We are vegan so stuck to things like rocket salad, humous, potato wedges, olives. We also had hot salsa, and a rather nice vegan korma. The food is filling, and there is no shortage of choice. I had an organic beer which was quite delightful, and my wife settled for a diet coke. My second beer was a bit flat, and they immediately offered me another one, no questions asked. All in, a very nice experience. They only accept bookings for four people or more, as they can virtually guarantee a seat if you're two. People, that is. Not years. Highly recommended."

You fill your plate and then queue up to pay by weight which may not be to everyone's taste, but in my opinion it works.

We've now been to a good selection of vegan restaurants around London, and were excited for the prospect of Tibits.First of all, I ordered a specific bottled beer from the menu. When I received the bottle, it was not what I originally ordered, and when I informed a staff member, I was told they discontinued it. So, I asked for another beer on the menu, and the staff member looked at me, sighed, said ""didn't you want this one?"" I responded that I didn't order that one, and wanted another choice. With a cross look on her face, she got me another one, and didn't even offer to refund the difference, I had to ask myself.Whilst I had been getting the drinks, my friend who had gone off to the buffet, returned with a small starter sized portion, which to my shock cost around £10! Absolutely unacceptable.Then it was time for my turn at the buffet. The food displays were clear about what food was acceptable to which diet. I was happy to overlook a single rude staff member, if the quality of the food was outstanding. Thus, I loaded my plate up to a typical buffet-sized plate, and was charged over £25 for this. Although I was rather annoyed at this cost, I digged into my food. Surely it must be worth the hefty price! However, almost everything on my plate tasted like balsamic vinegar; I honestly found it difficult to finish the food. Not at all due to the portion size, it was just that almost everything had a ridiculously sharp taste.I've never been more let down by a restaurant in my life. If you want to go to a decent vegan restaurant, I'd suggest going elsewhere. In fact, I'd bet you'd have more satisfaction if you went to your local kebab shop."

The downside to this was that there was a long queue for the food to be weighed and to pay, meaning I was stood there with my food going cold as there were only two people serving at the tills/weighing scales, with other staff members making drinks. While I had a starter-sized portion, with the intention of going up to the buffet more than once, I was put off when the price came to almost £10. My friend, who had a larger portion, was charged £27 for one plate of food; for this price at other restaurants, I would expect the food to be gourmet, or of a much higher standard, which unfortunately was not the case here. Although the food was nice, it was definitely not worth the price. Additionally, we were unable to book a table as their online booking page and phone service only allows you to book for tables of four or more. It would have been better if we were able to book a table for two, as we ended up being seated at a section right in the corner, almost behind the bar, using what was basically a shelf as a table. The best thing about our visit to Tibits was the cocktail I had, which, for London, was a reasonable price. There are definitely plenty of other veggie/vegan restaurants in London which offer a much more pleasant dining experience and value for money."

There is a ground floor seating area and another bright spacious area downstairs.There is a central buffet island with a wide variety of foods. It's probably worth doing a lap before choosing. The bread and the sauces are excellent.It is a simple system of charging- they just weigh your plate at the counter where you can pick up soft drinks.(25ml tutti fruition is £3.60 and 50ml Hildon still water is £2.10). A very adequate lunch plate of very appetising and varied food is about £7.00. A good variety of desserts are also available if you still have room. It is clearly a popular place with plenty of regulars.I would recommend the place without hesitation.

On arrival you wait by the door till you are shown to a table and then you can help yourself from the buffet style dishes laid out in the center of the restaurant (if downstairs you need to go upstairs).The selection is broad, the vegan food is fresh and tasty, it varies from interesting salads to hot food like rice, pasta and stroganoff style dishes. They also have desserts, cold and hot. You can use multiple plates to separate your cold and hot, or dessert from main. Its difficult not to get carried away when it all laid out in front of you but this is where you need to be cautious. Its £2.40 per 100g at lunchtime, and 100g isn't that much. Now for Mayfair this is not expensive, but it's not cheap either and you could easily find yourself with £11 worth of food and thinking about getting a snack mid afternoon. There is a water fountain tucked away to the side of the stairs going down, where you can fill up your own glasses with water for free. The tray's are quite small though so its a bit of a balancing act as there is no counter at the water tap to rest your tray on. Service is really minimal as you are getting your own food, so I can't really comment on that side of things, but most staff are friendly and you don't feel rushed. You get what you pay for, so it's tasty and healthy and ticks many of the right boxes but in my book, for what it is, I find it a little pricey."

There's lots of healthy choice, but it's also quite easy to eat badly if you want - I enjoyed the battered onion rings and deep fried jalapenos with sour cream. It's difficult to know exactly how much you have picked up, so when they weigh your food you might be surprised with how much you spend. I got a large plate for about £14, and this was plenty of food.There's a wide drinks selection too, both alcoholic and things like fresh juices.It was very busy when I went but we easily got a table and the self service means you can spend as long there as you like."

It is tricky as you don't know how much your plate of food costs and I was careful to try as much as I could without overloading the plate -my plate of food was £8, so then we decided to go for puddings too(soya used instead of dairy with some options). Next time I would not worry quite as much as I thought that everything was delicious and would have happily paid more for a bigger portion. The staff were really friendly and clearly explained the concept. Great peppermint tea with fresh leaves too. Wish I lived in London and could go often. Already promised my daughter that I will take her there (and neither of us are vegetarian)."

On the plus side, I thought the selection and quality of food was great. It was really tasty. On the down side, if you want to set up a tab, which you really need to if you are going to go up several times and also get drinks, you are asked to leave your credit card behind the bar. I do not think this is very safe as it is handing all your details over to a complete stranger. The alternative is to pay every time you go up. In our case, we went up twice to the salads, twice for drinks and then for a pudding. There were 3 of us so we used the card loads of times. I think this idea is crazy. If you don't have a card, you have to pay in cash, handling dirty coins and then sit down and pick up your bread roll. The payment system spoiled an otherwise lovely veggie lunch for us."

It is kind of buffet, you can choose from more than 40 different dishes that partly changes every day and you pay for weight, so You can take as much or as little as you feel like. Food is not too specific, high quality, healthy and really delicious! Surrounding is cozy and not pretentious. Tibits is located in the very centre and prices are good! (especially comparing to London prices). I recommend Tibits to everyone and I believe You won't be disappointed. We were coming back over and over again. The only problem that food is so good that you want to try everything and it is difficult to not over eat."

However, a chance encounter with this cozy li'l place called Tibits had us begging for more. This place is very different right from the word 'go'. First of all, it is 100% vegetarian. Secondly, it includes a global fare - food from all corners of the world. Thirdly, the pricing is weight based. (Once you've chosen what all you want and loaded your plate, just take it to the billing counter where it will be weighed and you pay as per the weight. Simple).The food was fresh and had a medley of different cuisines from different parts of the world. Entrees, salads, main courses, side dishes and desserts. Pick whatever you like. The cous cous dish in particular was extremely yummy and so were the okras. Well, to be honest, there wasn't just one dish I could single out - I liked every one of them!It is a Self-serve restaurant - very clean, affordable and yummy !!!

Thankfully because I had read up in advance we understood we weighed our plate of food and paid for it then. It would be very easy to mistakenly sit down and start munching without realising!The food was very tasty and a huge selection. About 75% was vegan and all labelled as such. The crumbed cauliflower was my favourite. They also had a great selection of vegan desserts. We had sticky toffee pudding and chocolate cake with vegan cream. Heaven!Overall it cost just under £45 for two big plates of food, desserts and drink each (my mums was free because of mothers day). I think this was a decent price for what we had."

Come back Food for Thought in Neal's Yard!. I am not familiar with the idea of weighing the food taken at the buffet. This habit compares unfavourably with that of other restaurants that provide veggie buffet ""eat as much as you want"" menus such as Diwan's and the Bhel Poori House in Drummond Street, who have a fixed (much cheaper price). We were not informed when we entered the restaurant that we needed to do this and had we not been with people who knew this we would have just gone and sat down at a table and eaten, assuming a waiter would have then given us the bill!. The restaurant also messed up the reservation, and we had to ask where cutlery was.The food was Ok though. Not brilliant although somethings were very good eg the tahini was exquisite and the tofu au vin was excellent. The sticky toffee pudding was nice, although had better. However, it is not a patch on Amico Bio or the two Indian Veggie Restaurants mentioned above, or Rani's buffet in Finchley. The range of dishes is wide, but not as mutually complementary as in the Indian restaurant buffets.The wine was terribly expensive at 4.50 a glass the cheapest option. A family of five we spent £140 which was way way too much for the quality.I could not make out whether they had an a la carte option, which kind of fits with the poor level of information given by the staff and the way they got the reservation wrong.The building it is in is really quite nice especially upstairs. Downstairs is rather dowdy though and needs a makeover.Bottom line is...if you are in town pre theatre or shopping, and chose carefully and not too widely from the buffet you might eat well under £10 (but not sure). I gather their menu changes each day which is great but maybe they should concentrate on less variety and try and produce menus where the options are complementary. Their pricing structure needs a rethink as standing around waiting for weighing means the hot food gets cool."

Our daughter who is fiercely loyal to Tibits still loved it, but my wife and myself were not so impressed - now considering that we love the place and always go there - this is not sour grapes.One point worth highlighting is the fact that by the time you took your plate to the counter to pay any hot food had gone cold by the time you got to a table.I'm really sorry to give this review as we have spent many happy mealtimes at Tibits.We will try again on our next visit to the City and hopefully things will have got back to normal.One final point, the restaurant is really cool and looks great BUT the management must start to look after the toilets better, they have never been great and are also getting worse.So - come on Tibits management, you can do it."

I'm not used to having choices. I want to try everything! It takes me forever to decide. Very boring for whoever's eating with me. But not at Tibits! It's PERFECT! A huge range of delicious dishes, and you can have a bit of everything you fancy! The only decision is when to stop adding to your plate, which you then take to the bar to be weighed - you pay for the amount you eat. There's also a great range of drinks, the desserts are wonderful, the ambience is cool and relaxed but not 'hippy' like a lot of veggie places. I literally ate until it hurt both times I've been, and I'm planning on coming back whenever I can."

The selection of food on offer is very varied, with hot and cold dishes as well as breads and dips. The dishes were nice and the flavours very good in some cases but unfortunately I have to agree with other reviewers who mention that the hot food is tepid at best. Given once you have got your plate of food you then have to queue at the till to pay (which took quite a long time on my visit), the hot dishes are stone cold by the time you get back to your table. The food is VERY overpriced. I was quite restrained when it came to the quantity of food and was horrified when the amount came up on the till. I don’t have experience of any other vegetarian restaurants so can't compare but I certainly won't be visiting Tibits again and I'm sure there are several better options for vegetarian dining in London."

Overall I had a jolly good time and the drinks were ever so creative and the restaurant was so cool!!!! So I definitely recommend it to everyone in the universe."

It was open at Sunday at 11am, and somehow I thought it would have a brunch menu. It didn't. Showing up at 11:15am, I had to wait because the chefs were still setting up the self-serve buffet, so digging in time was more like 11:45. Dreaming of vegan pancakes (my bad) I ended up eating a variety of vegan salads and a sampling of the vegan hot offerings. The buffet was clean and meals were clearly labeled with codes for vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, etc. That was a nice touch. The food was OK and I appreciate the philosophy behind this chain (started in Switzerland). It truly lives up to being a cozy, warm cafe. The price is by the weight, and loading up the plate ran me around GBP24. I thought pricey for vegan buffet. They did have some interesting salads, the beet was my favorite. Although I ate there two other times, I can't remember much else being remarkable. The toilets downstairs were not well serviced. One of my dinner's there, on a cold, dark, London night, would have been ideal for a hot soy chocolate - however they had run out of the chocolate. Not sure how that happens with Whole Foods open and just a few blocks away. But a friendly hot soy caramel recommendation from the server at the bar (where you weight your food and pay) also did the job. For a solo diner, there is a more private tables downstairs. Lot's of hustle/bustle upstairs."

This was fine as we had a few drinks at the bar (quite pricey) and eventually sat down for some food.You fill up your plate from the buffet and then get it weighed. It's pretty good value for money, but for me the vegetarian selection wasn't great....not enough cooked items and lots of salads etc. which is fine, but not interesting vegetarian food ie stuff you could easily make at home.All in all a good place if you're a proper veggie and don't mind buffet style food."

The deserts were also very expensive, it came to £9 for s small portion of sticky toffee pudding and plum crumble.Seating was also an issue. There were lots of tables spare but the waitress sat us right next to another couple, literally inches apart. We were basically sitting together so it felt very obtrusive.

It's a great place all round, conveniently located in a pleasant square just off the main shopping thoroughfare of Regent Street. It's slightly pricey, but since food is charged by weight, you can go for smaller portions if you want. The restaurant also seems to offer a competitively priced take-away service, though I've always chosen to dine in, as there's a lovely atmosphere. Particularly good points are the excellent range of fresh salads, fruits and vegetables, with a fantastic selection of fresh smoothies, tasty sauces and gourmet vegetarian and vegan delicacies. Tibits' self-service tap water machine is a welcome addition, as are the noiseless wheeled trolleys used by their chef and catering staff. Only drawbacks are that the tables and chairs can sometimes seem a bit cramped when the restaurant is very full, and the toilets downstairs could do with a good make-over. Were it not for these small irritations, I would rate it top marks for being one of the best vegetarian/vegan eateries in London. Hats off, though, to Tibits' welcoming and friendly staff, great food and drink."

The atmosphere is so laid back and relaxed. The buffet has a good variety of things and many vegan options too. I tried a bit of everything but I found most dishes to be a bit bland (but then again you can tell they use less salt and prefer clean flavours). Not bad! I just knew that if I was to make the same thing at home, it would taste a bit better. Overall, a vegeterian buffet restaurant is an excellent idea. The place is clean and the dishes are good enough and at a good value. Would love to visit again."

After we had eaten, a member of the staff came to our table and told us in a very rude way that we should tidy up the floor, ""as this is really a mess”. He used the word ‘mess' a couple of times. He was referring to a space on the floor of maybe over 1 square meter where toys were lying on the floor (the restaurant offers many toys for children!). This was between our chair and a chair of the neighbouring table. We kept our baby in this small place by our side, not only out of respect for other guests, but also because it wouldn’t be safe for our baby. No other customer complaint to us, nor did he mention a complaint, nor was this really blocking the way through. The man turned out to be the restaurant manager. When our 2 year old toddler emptied a crisp bag, he said to my wife in a loud voice “This is what I mean!”. After asking him whether he has children and explaining how difficult it is to go out with toddlers (tying to get a sense of empathy), he kept talking to me in a very unfriendly way. This is utterly unacceptable and disrespectful for families with young children. We left immediately and will never visit this restaurant again."

We booked a table in advance and settled down with my friend's two toddlers - who found the toys very interesting. The food was very healthy and creative but I was very surprised at how expensive it was - you pay by the weight and my regular plate of food came to £18!!!! The children had fun and made a bit of a mess with the toys (as children do) and to our utter horror the manager came over to us and completely shouted at us to clear up everything as it was danger to anyone trying to walk past. His tone was extremely loud and rude and this left my friend (the father of the children) very upset and embarrassed. It completely spoiled the whole experience for us all and we could not wait to leave. The manager could have spoken to us more discreetly or politely. Moreover, it was not just the children in our group that had made a mess or that had played with the toys!! We asked him if he had children and he said no as we tried to explain that they are sometimes messy with toys. To make matters worse, the toilets were disgusting in this place as was the baby changing area, which resulted in another parent changing their child in the restaurant rather than in the proper facility. I would not advise anyone with small children to use this place as it is definitely NOT child friendly and the staff are awful."

The idea of a fully vegetarian buffet really appeals to me, but value wise, I'm not a fan. If it was £10-12 all you can eat that would be fine. I felt like I was looking for lighter food, and planning what I selected- I get that's kind of the idea to prevent wastage, which I have seen at other buffets. The food is fresh, there a good selection, and tastes good, but the price leaves a bitter taste. Probably won't go back."

Being just off Regents Street Tibits was perfectly located after an afternoon shopping on Oxford Street and we decided to go in for an early dinner before heading back to the hotel to get ready to see a show on the night. It was around 5 o clock when we went in and it was relatively quiet at this time. The waitress explained the concept and we helped ourselves at the 'boat'. There was a very good selection and everything we tried was really tasty! The next night we were due to try a different restaurant called Mildreds which is about a 10 minute walk away from Tibits but they dont take resevations and when we arrived the place was so over crowded and there was at least an hour wait for a table so we dicided to head back over to Tibits. The food was great again and there was lots of different choices from the day before which was good. It was much busier this time as it was 7:30 in the evening, but the weather was weirdly warm for October so we decided to eat outside to make it a different experience from the previous night. Both times the food was excellent but I would say its rather pricey for what is essentially just buffet food! Also because its not table service even for drinks and youre having to get up mid meal if you want another drink it puts you off buying more drinks, on a whole though it was great to go somewhere where my vegan husband could have so much choice."

As a keen lover of soup, I'm always happy if there's a soup option. During my recent stay in London, I sampled two different Tibits soups (pumpkin & chestnut, red lentil), both very much to my liking. If only the bread rolls were slightly more 'substantial', I'd be perfectly happy with a Tibits soup meal."

The main drawbacks are that it's self service (pay by weight) and can get very crowded and busy, such as when we visited one Saturday lunchtime. The food is set out on a rather small oval counter in the middle of the restaurant. Desserts rubbed shoulders confusingly with main dishes: what I thought might be a squash crumble was actually plum. The plates offered are also on the small size, so even an average portion of 400g (costing about £10) ends up with everything squashed together. The food we tried was tasty on the whole, although someone misjudged the vinegar in a couple of dishes, and a couple of others were a little bland."

We enjoyed the decor and found it conducive to sitting back and enjoying our cocktails/wine/beers. The restaurant is buffet style, which I quite liked. I could pick and choose what I wanted and the amounts. I piled my plate with salads and the cost came to 10 Pounds. Not bad considering how much food I had managed to select.I found everything to be fresh and tasty. If I'm not mistaken, Tibits is related to Hiltl, the famous Zurich-based vegetarian restaurant.I really wish (hope) they would consider opening one in the US. Preferably in Boston please."

Couldn't believe the price for the type of food. The food itself is nice, generally tasty, but not amazing. The novelty is the buffet style which is fun, but I won't be going again.

The falafel, onion rings, guacamole, south-eastern curries, mini pizzas, vietnamese vermicelli and tofu sticky/blueberry crumble pies are the best! It's also one of the main locations for the popular London Vegan Meetup which gets on average 80 ppl attending to every event. What I dont like are the really low bathroom tap nozzles and that it can get really hot downstairs in the basement. And also there's no reception on your phone. Apart from that it stays on my top 10 vegan rest to eat in London with every Tuesday serving exclusively vegan dishes."

I had a completed loyalty card and so I went in to collect my free juice and the guy behind the counter had so much attitude and was so so rude. He also wouldn't stop staring at me which made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. Whilst he was making the juice, I simply asked whether it was possible to have it take away as I realised he was making it in a glass and as he turned around, in a very derogatory, abrupt and churlish manner said ""YES, IT IS POSSIBLE!"" I then decided to say something to him as I also work in customer service and can't stand bad service, especially when this particular gentleman is at work and is getting paid to treat people in such a rude manner. I said to him ""Sorry, have I done something to offend you, as I feel you are being very rude"", to which he replied ""No. I'm not being rude"" and continued to stare at me as though he was thinking ""stupid woman"". I left, feeling horrified by how bad the service was and as I was drinking my juice I found a label in it!!!! I unfortunately, wouldn't put it past him to have put this PURPOSELY in my drink however I am utterly confused as to what I had done wrong, simply by walking into the restaurant. I understand everyone has good days and bad days but you really shouldn't be working in customer service if you can't put a smile on your face. I actually think the manager was stood next to this guy who was serving me but didn't say anything! Anyway, it goes without saying, I will not be returning to Tibits anytime soon.

The food was fresh and flavoursome, loads of choice of both hot and cold veggie and vegan options. Lots of tofu dishes including a curry wurst, which was really tasty, and this is coming from someone who likes her meat! Don't make the mistake of thinking veggie food = healthy, there were plenty of deep fried options, not to mention curry, mashed potato, humous and noodles to up your calorie intake. Surprisingly only one pasta / couscous salad was on offer and there were no potato salads. Plenty of greenery and mixed salads, Tuscan, Caesar etc and the guacamole was lovely. Great paneer too! I was surprised there was no selection of cheeses, you'd have thought being a vegetarian place they would take the opportunity to make cheese the star of the protein category...Desserts didn't look great, just a few things tagged on to the end of the main course buffet. I think there was an uninspiring looking cheesecake and a few other bits I glossed over - and I'm a dessert lover! Only downside was the price! I had a smallish plate, just enough for lunch, and it cost me £12.50. I know it's central London but with no meat on my plate I thought that was quite expensive for the portion size. I can easily envision spending about £20 on a plate if I went for an evening meal. Loads of tables and great to sit outside on a sunny day. Would recommend to anyone, meat eater or veggie, just be careful how much you put on your plate!"

Just off the hussle and bustle of Regent Street, it is a lovely location with a nice outside eating area, should the weather be nice, as it was for us. We were met by very attentive staff who explained the routine and helped us to a nice table. You basically work your way around the buffet bar and at the end weight and pay for what you have - there are probably a couple of dozen options, plus desserts. Being a new 'flexitarian' couple, we wanted to try as much vegetarian options as possible and each one was delicious - some nice wine options also, that we took advantage of.

The restaurant is in Heddon Street, a quiet location right off the super busy Regent's Street. I went here for a Saturday morning brunch in July 2015. The restaurant is spacious and has a bright, clean, and relaxed atmosphere. It is a great place to have a leisurely low-key meal. The windows and doors were wide-open and there is also an outside dining area; a great place to visit on a sunny day. The staff were friendly and gave good customer service. The buffet had lots of different dishes to choose from. The food was delicious and well-presented; the food was clearly made with fresh ingredients. The different textures and colours were a treat for the eyes and the mouth! The hummous and guacamole were mouth-wateringly good. The food is a little pricey, but worth it. The restaurant is very vegan-friendly and I would definitely recommend it to others. I can't wait to go back next time I am in London!"

We really should have realised that there was a reason everywhere was busy outside on this balmy Thursday evening apart from this place. The 'organic and vegetarian' food and drinks menu was incredibly bland. There was a rather tasteless buffet which was chargeable by weight. I ended up paying about £15 for something I would have got in morrisons for £2.50. The organic larger was pretty rough as well. This restaurants final nail in the coffin was its gormless staff. There was barley an ounce of personality between them. I was also rudely approached by someone who I think was the manager, telling me smoking wasn't allowed outside. I pointed out to him that the sign on my table says that smoking is allowed when the windows weren't open. He completely ignored me. There are much better vegetarian restaurants around. Avoid."

My only warning would be don't do what I did and pile your plate like you're at an all you can eat, I went for everything and the plate of food (paid for by weight) cost £24! It's not cheap but it's so high quality and tasty it's worth it, just make sure you only get what you really fancy and not a bit of everything! In my home town there's nowhere for vegans to eat so I had a bit of a gorge on the desserts too, a huge bowl of sticky toffee pudding and this awesome angel delight style strawberry cream cost £13 but I did get about two people's portions. I'd have been sad about the price if the food wasn't good but it was perfect.One more warning is the cocktails are STRONG, I had a lychee martini and it tasted of pure neat vodka, value for money in terms of units but it wasn't pleasurable to drink at all, my friend actually took hers back as she couldn't drink neat spirits.Super friendly staff too, the guy at the till was really helpful and asked if I had any recommendations for improvement and I genuinely didn't. And a really cool waitress came up to talk to me about my animal rights tattoo letting me know about activism in the area. We will definitely be returning when we're next in London. Worth every penny for a treat. Lovely little courtyard too, we sat next to a massive open window as it was gorgeous weather but it looks like the kind of place that'd have a nice intimate atmosphere at night."

Food was slightly better than last year but still very over-priced for what is essentially ordinary salad. Staff were not particularly nice this time around - a grouchy waitress bit my partner's head off when he attempted to pick up an onion ring with, shriek, the tongs from the jalapeño croquettes next door. Staff on the tills failed to mention that the bread rolls are complimentary (so do not need to be weighed) - luckily we remembered in time and they then admitted that was the case. We also wanted to bring a small vegan cake with candles but were informed it would cost £1 per head. This seemed rather mean, as the puddings on offer (crumbles, mousses etc - which the guests were happy to purchase, we weren't trying to avoid paying for pudding) were not really suitable for the whole candle thing. In the end we opted to put candles on a portion of crumble rather than fork out another £15 for the privilege of using our own tiny cake!One positive thing (other than the fact that vegans do actually have a decent choice of food here) is the child-friendly atmosphere. In the downstairs area there is a play corner for kids and plenty of room for them to run around without disturbing diners without children.So, happy to come here and celebrate with vegan friends or family, but wouldn't dream of eating here otherwise."

The food is mostly hot and fresh but there are times when things look to have been out for some time and become lukewarm which happens in a buffet. The staff vary from exceptional to confused but generally the service is good. Yes it can be pricey if you load your plate with heavier items (you pay by the weight of your plate) - just think before you load your plate if you're on a budget. The desserts are great and always a vegan option which is great. Fantastic range of drinks on offer at reasonable prices (for central London).The decor and atmosphere are fabulous, it's always lovely to step away from busy Regent Street and find an oasis where you can chill out in lovely surroundings."

After my first visit I realised they were well deserved. I've been seven times now and all the food I have had has been excellent although I consider it quite pricey. Staff are helpful and the service is good and I have enjoyed their juices and coffee as well as the food. The food has always been tasty and well seasoned and I have not been disappointed by the taste. I consider it among the best vegetarian restaurants I know.Like many restaurants, the acoustics make it noisy. A place like this should take into account that a lot of its target customers would rather be soothed than deafened and this is something that good design can achieve.My real problem is with the desserts. On my first couple of visits, I didn't really notice but as someone who has a problem with gluten, I realised that other than fresh fruit, cream and yoghourt (VERY overpriced when sold at Tibits prices by weight) the interesting looking, mainly cooked dessert dishes (much enjoyed by my gluten tolerant friends) all contained gluten. On my third and fourth visits I asked whether they ever do any desserts that are gluten-free. I was told they would soon be introducing a new range of desserts and there would be several gluten-free options. That was last year. I'm still waiting. I went last week and they had a rice pudding in addition to the fruit, cream and yoghourt. Why would I bother at their prices? Given the quality of the main courses (and I would also like to see more of the main courses prepared gluten-free) this is disappointing. It feels like going back to the 1980s and it means that, after enjoying the mains, my last impression of Tibits on each visit has been disappointment."

You help your self to a plate and fill up from the buffet boat. Each great dish is fully labelled with the ingredients. Plenty of choice for vegans. Once your plate is stacked, you get it weighed. You pay per 100 g.Drinks are ordered at the till too. The food was so tasty. Ironically the sausages were loved by all of us and the guacamole too. All 4 of us are fine.For four plates and 4 soft drinks and 2 glasses of wine it cost £72. For London we reckon good value.Liked it so much I am taking some friends there at the weekend.Defiantly recommend to all."

It has to be said that the selection of drinks is also quite expansive. From teas to the usual coffees, good-quality wine, fresh juices and a lovely selection of cocktails. It's probably worth going just for an afternoon relax and sip. I had a fresh mint tea to start and then moved on to a lychee martini! Yes, it was strong, but so are all martinis or it wouldn't be a martini! Honestly, it was tasty, but I could only handle one on this visit. I'll have another the next time I go, which will be soon!The atmosphere is gentle and spacious. The staff are all super-friendly, not overly so; just helpful and present when you need them.There aren't that many good vegetarian restaurants around but I will count this as one of my favourite. The fact that they have vegan cream as well as double cream for the desserts shows a lot. What a lovely oasis in the middle of London madness!"

Went back yesterday and the offerings were much improved - more pasta, noodles, rice and hot dishes including a big bowl of excellent chilli sauce which definitely made my day. I would only say that they need to make more effort to veganize their desserts - for example, why not offer vegan cream to go with the pudding? And why add dairy yogurt when plant based yogurt is a perfect substitute? I was about to help myself to a tahini dip when I realised it had yogurt in it ....why? and if you must, then please try plant based yogurt, it works just the same as dairy yogurt. All in all, it is the best self service restaurant for vegans with a huge variety of foods to choose from and the Rose is worth every penny."

Don't forget the yummy puddings...if you have room...also all veggie (some vegan). The restaurant itself has a very relaxed vibe, doesn't matter if you just pop in for a coffee or sit down with friends for dinner, the style is very much 'at home' and comfortable. The food can seem a little pricey for a buffet (around £12-15 for an ample plate of food) but it is all delicious and fresh and the staff are very efficient at replenishing the buffet so you're not waiting there for your favourite dish to come out!

My son tried kebab sandwich. My wife, daughter & myself just filled our plates with a mixture of dishes. Like a buffet, but for a change, you don't see plates overflowing with food. It's nice to see people just picking what they feel they can eat. Cuts down on wastage.We really enjoy the food. Very fresh and good variety. Staff were friendly and at hand if you had any questions.

Whilst I did take a look at the choices offered on their 'food boat' (buffet table) which all looked very fresh and appealing, but in the end I decided on a bowl of tasty pea soup. I can't comment on cost for the buffet food as its priced by weight (soup is a set £3.60), but note other reviews are worried that you could end up spending more than you'd intended. There's a free water fountain for tap water. I found it a very welcoming venue and I happily sat in my comfy chair, relaxing for a time after finishing my soup. It was a pleasant change for in-house music not to be overly loud (thank you!).Apart from a few 'glitches' (no spoon originally provided, I had to go back to the bar and ask, and then I had to ask about the bread roll - I wasn't automatically told to help myself from the food boat) and the water fountain not being seen straightaway meant I was up and down like a jack-in-the-box. Once all this was sorted, I enjoyed my soup. None of these things were the end of the world, just a little annoying (and some preventable).A few things which could make service run a little smoother based on my experience and on what I could see a happening from my chair:• Staff based at the entrance to fully explain the layout and where to weigh & pay - lots of customers looking around not sure where to go next. Or, a leaflet ready at hand for customers to read if staff are busy. They're probably normally there, but not when I arrived.• Perhaps separate the weigh & pay from the bar. I could see people waiting, and their food cooling down, whilst bar staff were mixing drinks. • Tell people, or place a sign above it, where to find the water fountain. Ensure there are available glasses - they'd run out and I had to ask a staff member for one. They were then 'topped up' with disposable cups. This seemed incongruous with trying to cut down on waste by not offering bottled water - which I applaud - but then counters it with throw-away cups. In all, an enjoyable visit and I plan to return to see what the main food options are like."

We were not at all disappointed, in fact the meal turned out even better than expected. On arrival, we were greeted warmly by a staff member and shown to a delightful table in the window complete with lit candle ! Immediately we were impressed by the calmness of the interior, the pleasant decor and this is even before we had looked at the selection of dishes on offer.Some 30 different choices awaited our decision and I finally opted for the leek and potato pie and pea risotto accompanied by a myriad of vegetables. The cheese-cake and tiramisu to finish were sublime and we reluctantly took our leave about 1.1/2 hours later replete in all respects..A couple of observations:1. Be warned, it's not cheap. If you pile your plate high for the main course and again for dessert and finish with a hot drink, you will not see much change out of £16 - £18 per person which is a substantial amount for a lunch. If you add a soup to start, your bill will hover about the £20 mark. In the evenings, prices rise higher still. 2. By the time you have selected your main course items, walked over to the till, queued to have your plate weighed, paid for your meal, waited for your change and receipt and walked back to your table, the food will have cooled down considerably. I like my food to be HOT (temperature, not seasoning) and by the time I had returned to my table the pie and risotto had lost a great deal of its initial warmth. I appreciate this is always a problem in ""buffet-style"" food however it seemed to be particularly noticeable on this occasion.Perhaps you would like to comment on both of these points as I would be interested to hear your observations. Note I am not complaining, merely trying to be helpful to others when making a decision to eat at Tibits. My advise is Go, Go, Go - you will not be disappointed."

I like to graze, so being able to pick and choose just the right amount of each dish is perfect for me. Obviously when paying by weight, a plate of spuds will cost you more than a plate of watercress. Just use your head. Craft your own platter. Mix hot and cold. Grab a freshly squeezed juice. Order a hot toddy so you can pretend your drinking is medicinal (it was, honestly!). Next time we're saving room for dessert."

Obviously as a vegetarian restaurant there is much more choice than, as a veggie, you usually get in a cafe/restaurant. The food was plentiful and tasty. The surroundings are nice - there is an outside terrace which looked lovely but it was too cold to sit out on the evening we visited. The self-service is good for making your own choice of food and size of servings. However, we did have to wait a little in the queue to have our plate weighed and to pay. I think it is a little expensive but it is central london and specialist and the quality is good. Wine and water is also self-service which is OK but gives it more of a cafe feel whilst the decor makes it more of a restaurant feel. Downstairs there are facilities for children which is good, although we didn't use them on this visit."

This was a new experience for me and have been known to go a little crazy when buying pic a mix sweets to I was cautious with my portion sizes. I needn’t have worried as my fiancé and I had a plateful of food each which was more than enough for us both for about £22. The selection was so large I felt like I had to go back for a 2nd plate for myself to try some of the food I’d missed on my first time round. The buffet selection was large and offered lots of variety, every time a dish got low someone would be on hand to replace it with a fresh dish. There was a large drinks menu as well with everything from different flavored teas to smoothies and juices, beers and wines. The restaurant itself had a good atmosphere and was very clean. The quality of food was also very very good. I am not a vegetarian but if I could eat like this every day I could easily become one. Overall it was a great visit and I will definitely be going back."

The procedure of eating - well it's a bit strange to have to pay for your plate every time you go up to the buffet or for drinks, but i can get over this for the great food:-) The value is pretty good - on my first trip to the buffet (my main meal) my full plate cost about £8. location is great too so i would definitely come back here any time im around the centre of london."

Look out for the tofu au vin- tofu and vegetables cooked down in a delicious red wine sauce- amazing.The bad- Even for central London the food is horrifically expensive, especially considering it is essentially buffet food. Even trying to be a bit thrifty my plate came to £15+. I also found myself restricted in that I tried to find food that would weigh less, so be better value. People should be aware that there's no way to weigh your own plate- you have to take it up to the bar to find out how much it is and pay. Part of me does think this is deliberate and that by not having a mechanism to weigh your own food they count on you overspending.I wouldn't come here regularly because I do think it's overpriced but I look forward to coming back when the evenings are lighter and spending an evening on the gorgeous terrace out front."

I didn't think there would be any need to ask about the ingrediants used because as far as I know Tibits is supposedly a vegetarian/vegan restaurant. I decided to ask the chef what the special was and he confirmed what the dish was and stated it definitely contained 'some meat.' I enjoyed dining here simply because it only served vegetarian/vegan food which tasted great but unfortunately as they serve meat which is not clearly labelled I'm not sure whether we'd like to dine here again which is a shame."

He showed me the dishes and that each had a note of which allergens of contained.I made my food choices based on that and despite only having the gluten free and vegan choices, I had a heavy plate which came to a hefty £17! It wasn't any larger than I'd normally eat for dinner but I imagine the hummus or something else made it heavy and a rather expensive meal. This was my first annoyance.I then, within half an hour maximum of eating, had a reaction to something which contained gluten and had a pretty awful 2 days following. I emailed the issue to the manager and was asked for a list of the dishes I'd eaten. The manager then confirmed those didn't have gluten in them and could only imagine that there'd been contamination from other patrons.This is all well and good except with the new allergen requirements, it isn't really appropriate to shirk responsibility especially when it could result in potentially severe allergic reactions. Suffice to say, I could not eat there again and was quite disappointed with the half hearted response from management - indeed I only received one reply and my follow up email was ignored."

I've been veggie for over 40 years so I've got plenty to compare with and Tibits is up there with the best. It's unpretentious, solidly good food at a very reasonable price, given its location.  You pay by weight, so it's hard to estimate what it might cost the first time and that's a drawback if you're very budget conscious. On the other hand, you get to choose how much you want to eat - I ate there with a friend who'd had a large lunch and didn't want very much, so it was a perfect arrangement for us. I liked the decor (nothing 'worthy whole food' about it, which made a nice change) and it goes into evening mode at 6ish, with lowered lighting and candles on the tables. It does get very busy and so far on my 2 visits I've avoided the main lunch and dinner times. For a coffee, segueing into lunch, it's perfect and at 5pm it was practically empty for an early dinner before an event nearby. Lastly, I like the fact that they don't madly overprice the wine. Not that it's cheap, but you get a 175ml glass for £4.70 (the cheapest), which for that location I thought was ok."

It's freshly replenished the whole time. You can see what you're getting, read the labels, and take the amount you want. We usually try several different things on one plate, tending to pay between £9 and £12 each. I think this is reasonable for food of this quality. You don't have to wait long to pay.

The food options do seem to change, so visit on multiple occasions to benefit from all the varieties. In total, two large plates of food, a pint of their own organic beer, a cocktail and two portions of pudding cost £44.

Everything I have tried is really delicious and am yet to find something that I don't like. I was really impressed with the food, but I do only come here if I have some extra to splurge"

I'm cline of 10 days fro year the last 4 years. But today, 18/12/2014, I say bye for ever.The reason: the quality of service and supervisor was terrible. Yesterday, the stafs, supervisor and cooker was all time taking care and cleaning the buffet. Today, not one. When we finish the first dish, we was to get dessert, leaving the drinks in the table. We collect our selves the finished plates. When we return to table, we found one lady in our table and all drinks disapear. We called the waitress, and she say that she cleaned the table because everything was finished. It was not trueand we needed show her our glasses full in the place where the staff keep the dirty service. In front of evidence she say not problem, and that she will refound our drinks. All this situation was in front of supervisor, that he don't make any intervention or any words.The lady come back with 2 small glasses, one with Coke and another with juice, that it was our drinks. Not any bottle or evidence about the origin of the drinks. Of course, we don't drink it, we have not any evidence about the healthy security of this rest of drinks. Like we don't like scandals, we get water and we drink water, and go out.In the door, when supervisor say to us, good bye and have you nice day with ironic atitude, we say him that we are very disapointed for the service, that we are regular clients and some staff even remember us, and that we don't go to come back never, because even one low class restaurant can not bring drinks that is not possible to know from where they bring. he say : I'm sorry and bye.I want to say that one waiter tried to talk with supervisor. I don't know his name. Only that he's from Poland, and I want say thank you.I don't like fight, I don't like scandals, I don't like high voice. We are foreigners in UK, country that we love a lot. My husband is coming from 40 years a go. Me, from 7 years a go. Never we suffered one treatment of arrogancy, feeling that they laugh of us in racist atittude.We don't like discussions. For it, when somebody treat us in bad way, we don't come back never and London has many nice places for to enjoy the food. I know that Tibits is succesful businessand to loss 2 clients of around 10 days for year is nothing for them. But, may be, this bad selection of staff and mainly supervisors, one day they can pay.Bye forever.Good memories, bad final"

However, the whole experience is pricey for a reasonable amount of food. We'd likely come back if in London but the price might be a disincentive for some. Tidbits is in a great location in London, just a short walk away from the Piccadilly Circus tube station. The outside and inside decor and seating are well designed and aesthetically pleasing. The nice staff explained to us about getting a plate then paying at the bar by weight and taking a seat. There are two counters - one stacked on top of the other - in a boat configuration. The top shelf has hot foods and the bottom has cold; there are many of both, with perhaps a few more cold options. There are many cuisines represented including Mediterranean, Indian, Asian, and British classics. Between the salads, dressings, curries, vegetables, casseroles and so many more dishes so there will likely be plenty of delicious things to suit most tastes.I put small portions of many foods onto my plate such that it was full but nothing was stacked on top of other food. This brings me to my main complaint about Tidbits: the price. Given that it is all buffet style so fewer servers and staff are needed, it was even more expensive than it should have been. My plate cost £9.5! It was all high quality food, but that seemed very expensive for a plate of essentially cafeteria-style dining. There was a sink and cups for tap water. The food itself was very good and for the most part very tasty. We went back for another small plate of desserts which were especially fantastic!!! We loved the mango mousse, sticky toffe cake, rice pudding with spices, and panna cotta! We honestly would come back just for dessert it was that good."

There was plenty of choice and considering it was a busy Saturday lunchtime it didn't feel overcrowded. I was impressed by the selection and I had some delicious salads, my favourite was one with green beans. The difficult thing is to not carried away and load your plate up with more than you need, which is easily done. On the menu they do suggest you don't overload your plate and then if you want more go back again, which is a sensible approach as you then don't pay for more than you need. I would definitely come back here."

All looked bright and fresh, and tasted wonderful. Oh I did have one hot item sweet jalapino in cream cheese in a breadcrumb parcel. Abfab! After my large plate (the only drawback is the weighing of the food which can get pricey if you have heavy items) I only had room for a small fruit salad which was good too.

So it is quiet and when on the day we ate there...the weather was lovely so we could eat outside in the open air. The food is served in a buffet. And the range is simply amazing......all types of vegetarian foods - mediterranean, lebanese, indian, and a whole lot of other types. I was drooling seeing the presentation. The great thing is you load your plate with whatever you want to eat....and you pay by the weight of the plate. The indoor seating seemed a bit cramped but in the lower level there is a lovely area for families with children. The food actually tasted very nice...the chutneys were amazing. And so was the falafel and so many other things. They had a variety of desserts but I had eaten too much already. I have to go back next time and start with desserts."

Tripadvisor reviews for vegan restaurants tended to allude to Tibits as the yardstick to measure all others by and nothing seemed to surpass it. That was sufficient to convince me to give it a go and my gosh, I'm glad I did. The dishes are clearly marked as to content and so enormously flavourful that you wonder why you ever bothered with dairy products at all. It's highly tempting to go back for refills and this will damage your pocket somewhat. But if you try to mix lighter food with more substantial, the price won't be too onerous (you pay by the weight of food you have on your plate). My wife and I have been three times now and the dishes have been different each time and always excellent. The interior has a really pleasant, relaxed atmosphere and if the weather's warm you can also sit outside on the terrace. This place is an absolute must."

We have visited Tibits many times now and it never fails to disappoint. You simply turn up and find a table, no booking required. You then grab a plate and walk around the food boat, choosing whatever takes your fancy. There is a wide range of options from healthy superfood salads to more indulgent options such as rich curries. I personally love the approach they have taken here - you can choose exactly what and how much you want and pay by weight. Price wise, at the time of writing, a large plate will cost in the region of £15 - £20. There are also dessert options although I have never tried them. We love this place that much that we even purchased their cookbook to make some of the options at home! The restaurant itself is well decorated and feels homely with scatter cushions and subtle lighting. There is an outdoor seating area for when the weather permits.It is worth noting that whilst this is a vegetarian restaurant, they do also have regular vegan days were all food on the boat is suitable for vegans. I have not visited on a vegan day but hope to do that soon."

I prefer a Tibits lunch to any of the other veggie/vegan buffets in London.I'm vegan and the selection is very good - all clearly labelled and the chefs check the area often to replace any empty dishes. I feel the buy what you want weighed by the plate works as people eat what they have selected/paid for and less food waste.I decided to try the pudding as there were 2 vegan choices - a Victoria sponge and a sticky toffee pudding - both delicious but a soya or coconut cream or yoghurt would be nice - I know they do vegan days but unfortunately I'd missed this by a day as I was in London for the vegan festival and had lunch the day after. I'd love to visit on a vegan day and know a lot of my vegan friends feel that it would be great for Tibbits to go all vegan as most food options are actually vegan anyway.Staff are always friendly, helpful and smart, the whole place is always really clean and tidy with a great atmosphere.Tibbits please open a branch in Birmingham - I really think you would do so well there and I would be a regular customer!"

Once the system’s been explained to you it’s easy. The buffet system is based on weight, so you load up your plate, get it weighed and then you pay for it. Obviously the more you load on, the more you pay, but our mains varied in price from about £11-£18. Not the cheapest, but comparable to prices for meat/fish dishes in central London. The food is extremely varied with a really good selection to suit all tastes (Oriental, Asian, Italian etc). All seemed very fresh, tasty and well seasoned without being overly salty. There’s not a wide choice on the pudding front but the beauty of a buffet means you can have three small puddings which is what I did and then you get to taste them all! Nice fresh juices (tip: water this down with their free tap water and it will go twice as far!). They also have a loyalty card – buy five mains over £5 and get one free juice drink! Nice ambiance (not too noisy so you can chat easily), but rather dark. Would have liked more light to see what I was eating and it wasn’t even dark outside!"

So the starting point for Tibits (who serve only from a buffet) was challenging.The food must be really really good when it's fresh, to remain good an hour later (or maybe more - who knows?).What i've eaten tasted as if it's been there too long and was not seasoned enough.The Gnocchi were a bit dry, the tomatoes-tofu saled was tasteless.

The taste of food is good but not special. The reason why I rated it as average is that it is very pricy, the price you pay is based on the weight of the whole plate, you have to weight the plate after you have selected the food.

It's one of my favourite veggie restaurants in London. However the last couple of visits have been a let down. The food is delicious but massively over priced...around £16 for an average sized plate of essentially salad (no not piled up either!) - it's always been expensive and I usually grin and bear it but for this price you do not expect to be standing in a queue holding your plate, Oliver Twist style, for 15 minutes, waiting to pay, whilst your food goes cold. This is unacceptable when you are paying this much money to eat here. The same staff serving on the tills were having to also make the drinks, they clearly need additional staff for this. In addition, the buffet boat in the middle was not stocked up, there were loads of people just stood around waiting for them to restock some key items all the while the existing food on the plate is getting cold. In addition, in all the years that I have been coming here they haven't once changed the desserts on offer. Allegedly they did also have banoffee pie this time but since it was one of the many dishes that had sold out and not been restocked I wouldn't know if this was the case or not. I really hope that Tibits sort this out, especially the speed of service as it used to be a lovely place to come."

The fact that you pay by weight makes it easy to go back up and get seconds depending on your level of hunger. I would definitely recommend visiting. It is in a good location, just tucked behind the main shopping streets. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating and free tap water is available (self service) and you just are able to order other drinks. Although the outdoor seating is mainly high bar stools which makes it quite uncomfortable to eat at. The restaurant was not very busy when we arrived and the staff are friendly and we sat around for quite a while after eating and weren't rushed to leave. A very pleasant and slow lunch, perfect for chatting and you can just pop up for another dish when hunger strikes again. Would definitely recommend!"

Of particular note: Okra Tempura; Onion Rings; Mediterranean Salad, all the dishes with tofu in (and there were a few); the Japanese Noodles and Rice; Falafel; Hummus; Babaganouche ...The only problem with trying everything was that my plate weighed in at 1.325kg and cost £34.50.

In case you were wondering you pay a set price per 100g of food (lunch and dinner are 2 different rates), and you fill your plate with what you'd like to eat, take it to the bar, order drinks and pay. If you want more you have to go round again and do the same."

It was recommended by our daughter who felt we would enjoy it.It is a self service buffet, which normally puts me off. But I gave it a go as we had been out on a long walk and needed some food even though it was only about 4.30pm. Upon entering we were invited to choose a table - options were inside our outside (upstairs or downstairs). There were several eaters outside and as it was a hot day we went inside to a very nice table for two at the back (with two proper chairs - several of the side tables have one proper chair (with a back) and loungers in the window space - cushions provided). The interesting and different facet of Tibits is that the food is weighed and you pay by weight. This means you can take exactly what you want (and come back for more as many times as you feel able). The first time we went there we paid separately for the food we took. We got a little wiser on the next two occasions and set up a tab by leaving a credit card. This makes life easier.There is hot and cold food. The hot food can cool down quite considerably - better to take it when the tray is full and you know it has just been cooked. The salads seem to be fairly standard but the hot dishes vary. We have now been three times and have had different meals every time.There is usually a soup of the day and a variety of sweets - must say they have been the same on all our visits. The cheesecake is delicious but very 'moreish'. The coffee is very palatable - quite strong as we like it without the need to ask for 'two shots' as one needs to with some of the more numerous and well known coffee franchises.In addition they do a loyalty card completion of which will get you a free fruit dish. Three further benefits; 1. It is open for meals all day.2. You can take as long as you want to savour the meal without any pressure to finish up.3. For a West End Restaurant it is reasonably priced.Thank you Tibits. We shall be back."

I sat outside in the sun and just chilled out there and enjoyed my day off for an hour or so. It was a very relaxed place.The waitress was very helpful explaining the format to me as I walked in which was nice.There was a lot of choice even though there was more cold than hot, and I would have personally preferred more hot than cold...I just feel like I'm getting more for my money then (and I'm not a big fan of salads)I had a tofu and mushroom stroganoff (type thing) with cous cous, rice, cream cheese jalepenos in bread crumbs with potato wedges. All these tasted absolutely lovely and was very hot and fresh.The dining area outside was really nice and the atmosphere was very friendly and not at all pretentious as some places are in Central London. There was plenty of seating and even thou it was a hot day & glorious sunshine I didn't struggle to find a space to sit. The staff are very friendly and seem to work very hard too (it was a busy day when I visited).The only slight negatives are that the toilets weren't the cleanest, but I suppose that's difficult to keep on top of during busy periods. Also, I only had a small portion on a small plate because I was eating out again for dinner so only wanted a small lunch, and that came to £6.00. If I'd have eaten enough to have been full up, it would have been at least £15 I'd say, then with a £2.50 small bottle of coke, works out a little more than I'd want to pay for lunch. But if you just want something to keep you going, this place is ideal for vegetarians and people trying to eat healthier.In relation to it being vegetarian, It's also nice to not have to ask which dishes are veggie and to have more than 2 boring meals to choose from like other places. Definitely worth checking out next time you're in Central London, and want nice healthy food and a nice chilled out atmosphere."

BUTWe arrived to find a cool fit out and a very good professional looking servers monitoring the room. The buffet system is quite clever so you can just pick up what you like and then head over to the counter where they charge you depending on the weight of your choices, you can head up as many times as you want but bear in mind the food is not cheap. The only point to be made here is that the dishes really taste curiously good. You dont miss meat at all and leaving feeling quite happily stuffed. Credit where credit is due and certainly better than the over rated vegetarian restaurant Mildreds."

There was so much to choose from that I opted for a bit of everything and that for me is the only downfall, it was rather expensive for a lunch as you pay by weight so you don't know how much you've spent unless you want to keep popping back and forwards. However, my friend and I only see each other a couple of times a year and to be able to enjoy such fabulous food in lovely surroundings I didn't object too much. The variety and quality of the food was superb and I would definitely recommend it."

Tucked away near Piccadily Circus tube station, this place has a stunning contemporary decor and friendly staff. When you come in, you are shown to your seat, and explained how it works. On offer is fresh vegetarian and vegan food buffet-style. You grab a plate, pile on whatever takes your fancy, then proceed to the bar where the plate is weighted, and the price calculated. Don't worry about the price- in fact, it's great value for money. A full plate will set you back about £8 to £9. The food is fresh and tasty. Even non-vegetarian friends love going here. Next time I'm in London I'll be back."

But I purposely went for the healthier foods and avoided any pastry, potatoe and pasta as i was having a 'good' day. I don't think there was anything I didn't like that I chose. Great if you are a fan of a quality buffet and I suspect very good for children due to the fact they eat with their eyes.

Very busy but we didn't feel particularly swamped and were able to talk. Pleasant and helpful staff. Free water and bread were nice touches. My only teensy reservations were:1. The pay by weight system was fine for what I ate but I suspect you could easily get caught out and rack up a hefty bill.2. I had to wait quite a while to buy a coffee with few people in front of me as the coffee machine was a bit of a faff for the staff. Nice coffee though.3. I'd be reluctant to leave my belongings at a table while visiting the buffet so it does tend to make you go one by one which is a pain, especially if the tills are busy.All in all though I enjoyed it and will certainly return."

First of all the business model is a buffet that is charged by weight, as such it's suitable for varying appetites, and minimises waste. The chefs must be commended for creating a selection of food which can satisfy even large appetites for around the £10-15 mark, something which many other restaurants fail to do.Those who enjoy meat will not find the menu lacking either, with chunky and flavourful falafels, and quiche being available. However there does lack a certain appeal to those who like spice, whilst there are many Middle Eastern and Indian dishes, none of them posessed the punch that one expects.They are very clever in that food is weighed right at the end, so it's easy to get more than you need, especially since the food tends to release it's energy slowly which means you won't get hungry again. So you have been warned, it's best to take a small amount and come back if you feel the need for more.Finally a note for those who are having birthday parties, they will charge a £1 fee per person for the cake, it seems reasonable as they will add candles and plate it up nicely for you."

Take note!My girlfriend kindly brought us both here for my birthday this year. The food was fantastic. It's a buffet so you get to help yourself. Luckily it was vegan night when we went (we are both vegan) and so we could choose literally anything we liked. I couldn't remember the last time I had that privilege! Unfortunately because of this I piled my plate up full of a bit of everything. You pay by weight, and despite this I was expecting my food to come to about £10. It ended up being £20 for 1 moderately piled plate of food. Very overpriced- so be conservative with how much you order, trust me. It's a shame you have to be though as the food was very tasty and there was a lot of choice, like 40 different things to try. Just be warned that I'm pretty sure they know that vegans rarely get that much choice, and so hike the prices up. What's more the food wasn't actually that hot, so was a shame. Best to probably start with a small plate as a starter to guess the cost of what the 'main' would be, that way you won't end up paying £20 for something that should be half that.Be sure to try out the Booja-Booja hunky punky cashew-chocolate ice creams they have in the freezer by the tills. Delicious.Tip- Self service water tap opposite the bar by the stairs- help yourself."

We ended up coming to Tibits as son and girlfriend, the vegetarians, had visited before, and being a buffet, no unexpected surprises would arrive for 'the more dedicated meat eater' in the party.We had a table for four, seated at one of the 'high' tables near the buffet counter. After an explanation of how things worked a quick 'reconnoitre' around the buffet, we went into 'attack mode'. All the food was beautifully presented and clearly labeled so no problems for 'the dedicated meat eater'.Everything we chose tasted great, I had a selection of hot dishes mostly of an Indian style, they proved to be as good as any Indian food I have had in London, spicy but not hot, and a good 'bite' to the vegetables . The only comment I would have was as this our first visit, and although we were not on a budget it was hard to know what we were going to pay. In the end we were very presently surprised at the cost. Two plates and two drinks coming in at around £20. For the atmosphere, and the quality of the food in the centre of London it was an absolute bargain. Us meat eaters have already decided that we will be back the next time we come up to London."

For the most part we tend to stick to Italian as she can usually find a decent vegetarian meal involving pasta and tomatoes.Whilst down in London for the weekend I turned to the Tripadvisor application and the ""near me now"" feature which nowadays I find invaluable.I found ""Tibits"", a highly recommended restaurant near our location and given the reviews I suggested we pop over to try it. It's slightly out of the way in the Food Quarter off Regent Street and without TripAdvisor we never would have gone there.I am so, so, happy that we gave this place a go. It is one of the best places I've eaten in a long time. The decor is lovely, very relaxing, and the service friendly and attentive. The format is that of a central buffet of delicious vegetarian food from which you sample what you will and then pay by weight at the bar.The place is also family friendly with a lovely downstairs area where mums and dads can feel comfortable taking their kids, and a play area (and breastfeeding area no less) where the kids can relax without interrupting the other diners.And the food, well I am speechless. As I said to my wife if I was eating vegetarian food like this at home then I would happily give up eating meat (and that is saying something).Bravo to the Tibits team. I can't recommend this place highly enough!"

So great for meet up and a good gossip. The toilets are clean too. You find your own table to eat at and you then grab a plate and help yourself. It has a variety of cultural dishes to choose from which include puds all made out of fresh ingredients. And yes you can tell the difference. You then take your plate to the till to be weighed so be careful. You pick up your drinks at the till. I have been there a few times and always found the food delicious and hot and the salads cool. As there is such a variety even non vegetarians will find something. I have only been there for lunch weekends and weekday and although busy we have managed to find a table. I would recommend, but can get pricy if you are not careful with your proportions."

They obviously had high standards and pride in the food and moreover the restaurant’s presentation, as they always seemed to be checking and wiping up any spillages.

Great also if you are dieting and want dessert, you can pile up the fruit and then still have a teaspoon or 2 of the fattening stuff. We thought the prices were reasonable.

We also enjoy the extras besides the main dishes, items such as cottage cheese, cashews, sauces and coconut chips.We purchased the 'Tibits at Home' cookbook to try some at our house.One area for improvement would be to lower the music volume. On weekends any music is not noticeable with the pleasant variety of happy conversations; however on weekdays when the restaurant was not full the music detracted from and did not enhance the atmosphere.

Desserts are also sold by weight but you can still try out a small portion of everything for about £5! Next time we go. We will know which are our favourites and focus on those (although I believe the menu changes every day and it become vegan for about 3 days per month).The staff were very friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our meal there.

Saying that though the jalapeño poppers and falafels were lovely and the salads flavourful. The places it's self is modern and the staff friendly but for not much variety the food was expensive (buffet but charged by the weight) I've been to other veggie places with a more exciting menu, so that let it down which was a shame as if was all well cooked and tasted good just not that exciting."

It is not haute cuisine but it's tasty and more imaginative than the average ""wholefood"" restaurant. The prices seem reasonable to me although to people from outside London it might seem expensive. I've been going regularly since shortly after the London branch opened and there is always something different to try, as well as old favourites like the salad made with dried green beans and walnuts which may not look like much but is delicious.There is always plenty for vegans like me and also for people who need to avoid nuts, gluten etc (presumably not so good if you had a serious allergy as everything is on the same counter). I have often been with non-vegetarians and they liked it too. On ""vegan days"" I believe not everything is vegan but all the hot food is.This place is great for a small informal gathering as not everyone has to turn up at the same time - if you want to treat your friends you can run a tab behind the counter and get everyone to collect their food individually and add it to the tab. It looks trendy but the demographic is mixed and as a non-trendy and middle-aged person I feel welcome. I have never had trouble getting a table but if it's busy you may need to sit downstairs which means carting your food up and down stairs or taking the (slow) lift.There are tables outside in Heddon Street (which is pedestrianised) which are nice but can go quickly on a sunny day. You can make a reservation if you have more than 8 people I believe.To show I don't work for them I will mention one downside which is that they sometimes play music rather loudly, and friends have grumbled about this. I haven't noticed it lately though."

It is more casual and snacky than formal dining. I took about the ‘system’ later. This is not a relaxing place but the food is worth it.In an alley off Regent Street, this restaurant in an experience. The food is arranged as a buffet and in terms of vegetarian food alone, it is unbeatable. The range of tastes and variety of food is amazing and brilliant. Everything was good.The food, and I can’t describe, is historic in (Michael Winners terms) with many main dishes. Contrary to one reviewer, there were more dishes then he experienced (so this may vary by the day) and I found them all filling. That reviewer had to stop for Ben’s cookie. However, if you are used to meat for a main dish, you will not be satisfied. My advice is take your time, don’t fill your plate with lots of dishes. Fill it about half-full and then go back. Experience a variety of dishes, then go back for more. It will take time but the experience is better.The buffet has starters, main courses and desert dishes arranged in tiers. Getting the food can be daunting because there are many people all fighting for food.The tables are close together and arranged more like a cafeteria. Best to stay upstairs. Going downstairs means you have to balance your food via flight of steps.There is no service. You find a table, Drop your things, ask a neighbour to look after them for you, select a plate size and get the food. As I said this is a process of queuing and delicately dancing around other people, or even jostling... Then you take your plate and join another queue. In this queue, you may have to wait some time. The system is your food is weighed, and you pay by eight. You also get a drinks (best to buy the drinks first in my view). The process of queuing, selecting plate, loading your food, having the plate or plates weighed and then paying, ands then weaving your way back to your table. tedious and lengthy. Every time you want some more you have to go back and pay. Your can’t have seconds. Your plate has to be weighed each time.This is messy. You tend to over-fill your plate to avoid going back to queue, weigh and pay queue. Hence, take your time, half-fill your plate and be prepared to return.The food is fairly expensive. Reckon on £50 a head without drinks."

Although there were quite a few things to choose from there weren't many with substance ie lots of 'salads' but only 2/3 main meal assortments (lasagne, wedges, tagine). I simply filled my plate up as I was pretty hungry and my partner erred on the side of caution and ended up with half a plate of food but with drinks it still came to £28. The drinks were very delicious but a little on the small side and I believe the food was a bit too expensive for what it was.

Below are seemingly hundreds of salads including; carrot salad, celeriac coleslaw, great hummus, Beetroot, green salads, a mix of soy beans, broccoli and mange tout in a lovely dressing. I could go on. There are breads too. You take your plate to the counter where you pay by weight and also order drinks of which there is an amazing selection if teas, coffees, juices, wine and cocktails. You can come back for more and there are desserts too. A great place, conveniently located, lots of choice and it doesn't feel as if you're ""missing out"" even if you eat meat.

Half way through a manager stepped out and approached us in the most unprofessional manner, was so rude. I had told her I totally understand but I would have liked it if you had spoken to us in a more approachable way, in which she refused to apologies and walked off and told us that next time she's on a shift and we are here we ""better remove ourselves from here"". As a manager I feel like this was resolved in such a disgusting way over some breadsticks, if she had explained properly then I would not be offended.

The battle between wanting to keep a place all to oneself or telling others so that they too can enjoy good food in agreeable surroundings... Christmas and the season of goodwill are upon us, so here's my review - and why not? Tibits deserves it!The fare is vegetarian. Don't think tasteless overcooked lentil dishes or nut roasts, but fresh, seasonal ingredients showcased in interesting combinations and presenting themselves as vibrant colours on the plate, with tasty dressings to complement them, a quiche and a couple of pasta dishes too, a plethora of salads and side dishes too. You will be spoilt for choice and there won't be enough corners on your plate. The food is ready-prepared and this is not to say it has been hanging around for hours under buffet lights. The staff are constantly bringing top ups and on no two days is the menu the same. (We came twice during our recent 8 day stay in London and enjoyed different dishes each time). Then when you have made your selection, you take your plate to the tills, whereupon it is weighed and you can order drinks. I paid about £8 for my lunch but my hungry husband, who sneaked in a falafel or two when I wasn't looking, paid a bit extra for his. A bread roll comes with your meal and is not counted as part of the weigh-in (thank you, Tibits). Tap water is also freely available, so it needn't work out expensive as I noticed others have suggested in their reviews. There are also puddings and a great selection of fresh juices, organic ciders and wines, if you fancy staggering back down Regent Street after your lunch. The hot lemon and ginger tea is zingy and so warming on a cold day - just what you need to get the blood pumping again.My advice is to go early, as by about 1 pm the restaurant gets pretty full. The acoustic is such that this brings a certain amount of noise during peak times, but for an early lunch it's fine.Just a couple of negatives, as nothing can be absolutely perfect and it's so important to give a balanced review. Firstly, one time we went recently my husband and I both noticed the dishes were overly salty: surprising, as we never noticed this before, and hopefully somebody just salted something twice, rather than this becoming a pattern which so often develops in restaurants. But we have eaten here many times and this was an isolated incident. Secondly, the tables are so close together that if you are eating and somebody comes to sit at the next table, they have to squeeze in to get past and then will struggle with the ill-fitting cushions on the banquettes to get comfortable, and totally interrupt your enjoyment of the meal. BUT don't let this put you off. It is tasty, nutritious food and the atmosphere is pleasant. The restaurant is in Heddon Street, just off Regent Street, so great if you're shopping nearby in Piccadilly or Oxford Street. Tibits does deserve to do well and we will certainly be coming back next time we're in London. Enjoy! And Happy Christmas!"

At any rate, we sort of graze through it, plate by plate until we are full enough (you will never feel truly full). Our bill for two, including cocktails, nuts and desserts was just above £50, but we did not stint ourselves. The main courses are usually a vegetable curry (or pumpkin), with a specialty rice. Other dishes are VEG VEG VEG, but each is so wonderfully well prepared, you can't get everything you want on your plate. Tibits may fall empty for a little while, but generally it is FULL of people, most of them foreign who know about it how? We just happened on it. Forget the desserts. Soya whipped mango cream? Forget it. The only one I like is the cheesecake, but they don't have it every night. For the record, neither of us is vegetarian. And for the record, you don't have to spend as much as we did.

Tibits has also a great and tasty selection of wine and beer - I especially love the Freedom Dark Lager. The breakfast selection isn't huge, but there are vegan options as well, so nothing to complain about from my side.

It's a vegetarian's heaven, and has been enjoyed by all the meat eaters I've taken there too!The food is laid out as a buffet in a 'food boat' with hot dishes on the top shelf and cold dishes below. You help yourself, get your plate weighed at the till and are then charged according to the weight of the food. You get one bread roll for free, so remember to lift this as you put the plate on the scales. Gluten-free bread rolls are usually provided too. Food choices may include things like falafels, currys, stir fries, quiches, breaded cheesy jalapenos, onion rings, seasoned potato wedges, rice, pasta dishes, ususual salads, lettuce, chutnies, dips, salad dressing, sprinkles, coleslaw and hummous. I like the hot dishes best, and can highly recommend the date and tomato chutney!I always order a juice drink called 'Tutti Fruiti' - can't remember exactly what's in it, but it tastes amazing! If you don't want to buy a drink, they provide water for free, that you can help yourself to (glasses and water spout against the wall opposite the tills).If you are arriving in a group of more than 2 people, don't be dismayed to see that all the larger tables are labelled 'reserved'. The restaurant staff seem to 'reserve' the bigger tables, so that singles and couples don't take them, and you will usually find that they are happy to show you to one of these tables. This works out quite well, and means there is usually somewhere to sit. Even if the upstairs is full, there's usually room downstairs.The toilet facilities are quite modern and have been revamped since I've been visiting - although they seem to have a design flaw (at least in the ladies) which means that water collects on the worktop around the sinks, and pools to the extent that if you accidently lean against it you can end up with a big wet patch on your clothes. Just a warning to be careful!I've eaten here countless times, and the food has always been fresh, delicious and varied. Everytime I visit the food selection is different, which means that no two visits are ever the same. The only thing I don't really like about Tibits is the desserts - which are often the same things that I'm not too keen on (like a cheesecake with a nutty base, and a crumble with a nutty topping) although the rest of my family seem to like them, so maybe it's just me.I visit Tibits at least 4 times a year, and I plan to visit again soon."

Both myself and my non-veggie boyfriend loved the range of food on offer and everything we tried was AMAZING! I'm always so indecisive so it was ideal to be able to sample a little of everything. My meal came to £16 and his £20 - we did absolutely stuff ourselves though! I believe the prices are extremely fair and the weight system is a great idea. Considering the variety of food and that everything was of such a high standard I think it's good value. I'm very much looking forward to returning.

I have eaten here at lunchtime or alone when shopping at night. I would recommend it but I don't see it as somewhere special enough for an evening meal or special lunch. They also offer a breakfast buffet (fruit / muesli etc) but I haven't tried that. Overall the restaurant is clean but the toilets needed a clean on the last visit.

It is such a lovely place in the center of London that offers outstanding food in a cosy atmosphere. There are dozens of different delicious dishes available including many vegan options. Moreover, they offer really flavoursome beer. We especially like the Freedom Organic Dark Lager Beer, which is vegan as well. Besides the great location and food, we highly appreciate the friendly, competent and supportive staff. We look forward to our next visit @ tibits."

I was a little hesitant at first when I heard it was a buffet-style, but I was assured by a friend that the food is creative and tasty, and the atmosphere is wonderful. He was right! It can get a little pricey if you aren't careful with how much you load up your plate since you pay by weight, but it's all worth it. Allergens and vegan items are very clearly labeled. All the dishes I tried were so good. And they have a full bar so I splurged and ordered a Pimm's and lemonade to go with my meal. Hostess (who was possibly the manager) was extremely welcoming and staff was helpful and pleasant. If you are in London and enjoy well prepared food, even if you are not vegan/vegetarian this place should be on your list!"

It is tucked away in the food quarter behind Regent Street.When we went (July 2013 ) it was tremendously hot and it was great to be able to sit outside and watch the world go by. Tibits is so simple, they welcome you in and give you a plate and the rest is up to you - you simply fill your plate from the massive selection on display, you then take your food to the counter where it is weighed and you simply pay there and then. This restaurant is so informal that it really is great. The food is superb and we really enjoyed ourselves - so much so that we ate there on three days. The prices are good value and it cost us about £15 each including a pudding - not at all bad for central London.There is no doubt about it Tibits was a good find by my wife and we will deffinately be visiting again on our next visit to the Capital.Just a quick point, why oh why is Tibits only in London and why only one restaurant, this concept is too good not to be shared - I'm absolutely sure that other Tibits in other major Cities in the U.K would do very well indeed.So very well done to this outstanding restaurant, thank's for looking after us and as Arnold Schwarzenegger said - well you know the rest!!!"

The food is really delicious and of great quality. There is a rich choice of vegetarian dishes both hot and warm. The only negative point is the price: I paid £10 for a plate which left my hungry, but the taste and range of the food is definitely compensating. The atmosphere is nice, we were lucky and got a lovely table next to the window overlooking the restaurant. The light is dimmed and I really enjoyed the design of the restaurant.So, maybe not a place to go if you are very hungry after a day out in London, but go there if you want to treat yourself with delicious vegetarian food."

This vegetarian bar is constantly ringing the changes so customers get to explore a vast amount of dishes, each one as scrummy and as we'll thought through as the next! You absolutely do not miss meat! (Which I was expecting to!) The unusual way of weighing your plate at the end of your self service offers you the opportunity to get a rewards card offering a free juice after 6 visits. This is a nice bonus! It is also a wonderfully quiet place to go for an after-work drink as it feels tucked away down Heddon St despite its very central location in London. You can hear yourself talk which is a rare thing in most restaurant/bar locations in central. Great atmosphere, great food, great prices."

We helped ourselves to two reasonably plates, which I would describe as medium sized to start with. To give you an idea of costs, this was Sat lunchtime and they worked out at £7 and £7.10 each. We went back for another plate which we shared for another £6.90 and then a fairly full dessert bowl which was another £6.90. Evenings would be approx 10% more. Using the help-yourself system means you can try lots of small portions if you want. The ginger lemonade is very good. We would go back."

This is the first time where it clearly states what is in the food and the first time I felt like there is so much choice. Though it is expensive but I don't mind paying if the quality is high and you get what you pay for.FOOD & DINING: The restaurant is buffet style self service but the choice is amazing and the food is very tasty. A lot of healthy options as well as raw food as well. They are quick to replenish foods that are low as well. One thing that I've never seen anywhere else is that they clearly state whether food includes onions or garlic as those are two foods I try to avoid. There are a great selection of juices available as well and for alcohol lovers I did see organic beer and things like that. Look out for the daily specials for juices as well. I missed that one until afterwards.SERVICE: Not much to say here as it was buffet style but all interactions were very pleasant and friendly. The food at the counter was very quickly replenished and there are staff walking about if you need anything. Our plates were collected off the tables when we were done as well though this could have been spotted quicker though it didn't hinder the experience.VALUE: Now the food you pay for is done by weight of the food which is different. The only problem with that is you don't really know how much you are paying until you go t the till and by that time it is already on your plate. The average price we saw about £10 per plate but then one of our friends did manage to rack up around £15 or £16!ATMOSPHERE: I like the ambience and setting of the place. Though the setting is quite irrelevant to the food they serve as the food as its more natural wich was pointed out to me. Though it was a bringing together of two aspects of dining I like so it sat very well with me, what they had done. Healthy food and warm atmosphere.DESSERT: The only thing I found a little uninspiring were the selection of desserts. They were nice but nothing spectacular so I went for their ice cream instead which was small tubs you can purchase. Good choices but they are small and yes I would say this is over priced.Overall the evening was pleasant and lovely created by the atmosphere and the food was great with no stress about the ingredients as everything ha been spelled out so very stress free dining if you are picky! Highly recommended vege restaurant and I will be a regular there!"

I was initially slightly sceptical as it is a vegetarian restaurant however the food was delicious and of good quality using fresh ingredients. Once you had chosen what to eat, the plates get weighed, and the weight equals the price. I found the restaurant to be pricey, but for an occasional treat was worth it. The only downside we had was when we went to help ourselves to the dessert there were only 2 options left. We asked the waiter if they were going to bring anymore out yet were told that the chef had stopped making the deserts so we would have to make do with the 2 options which were left. Now considering that it was only 9pm on a saturday night i was shocked by this. Overall the food was good with great homemade juices, just pricey."

I also would recommend that they offer different types of plant milks for their coffees, rather than just Soya. Almond and coconut milk would be welcome additions on the drinks menu. Overall, great food but not somewhere I will frequent based on the price."

The staff is friendly and polite without being in your face. It is self service and you chose from an array of hot and cold dishes. Once your plate is filled, you take it to the check out where it is wheighed and then you order your drink. As you pay by weight you have to be careful not to be too greedy or the bill might be a bit hefty. The food itself is fresh and tasty but the dishes on offer could be a bit more imaginative. My mistake was to put cold and hot in one plate which meant by the time I sat down my hot selection was lukewarm. I would recommend to put cold starters on a small plate and hot mains on a warm plate or eat a cold starter first and then go and chose a hot one. My vegan victoria sponge with vegan vanilla cream was really light and yummy. There is a good selection of hot drinks and my fresh mint tea was perfect. My vegetarian, vegan friends and my self a meat eater thought it was a great relaxing, comfortable place offering well prepared food. For my dessert I paid £2.30 for 0.110kg, mains came to £7.90 for 0.376kg and my fresh mint leaves tea £2.40. Bread roll is free."

The atmosphere of the place was more than great, colorful, cheerful, and comfortable seatings. The vegetarian bar that took my attention. Filled with fresh salads & veggies (Hot & cold), breads, Pastas, and many yummy stuff. The concept of this restaurant is to pay for the weight of your dish. You fill your plate with all the tempting variety of vegetarian dishes out there at the food bar, and then they weigh it for you and set the price depending on the weight. The taste was amazing! I enjoyed tasting and eating each item in my plate as though it was a gourmet food. Each has it special delicate flavor. I was expecting to have at least one or two things that wouldn't be that good in those selections. But after tasting them all I figure out that nothing in this bar wasn't good!! Everything was just perfect, and each bite was (Yum Yum Yum). I also came back the next day to this restaurant and had my lunch there."

It is located in the food quarter off Regent Street very close to the junction at Piccadilly circus. This is a fully veg restaurant with a unique concept. Pay as per the weight of your food. The buffet comprises of starters, mains and desserts. The drinks are charged separately. You can make any number of trips to the buffet and need to pay everytime you do. I found the per weight charges pretty steep which means for one person to have a good meal, along with drinks, it could set you back by £20-£25 per person. This might be a fair price to pay for a London restaurant but then you could get much more for the price at other places. The restaurant ambience is great. It is located at two levels with a more informal dining experience available in the basement. So all in all, for those strict vegetarians or vegans, this is a great place to visit. Definitely worth one trip to experience the concept. I have already been here thrice and I am a non-veggie. So that speaks in favour of the restaurant :)"

I have managed to eat there 3 times since it has opened and each time it has lived up to the standard I have come to expect from it. I had been initially concerned that it wouldn't be able to capture the unique flavours and atmosphere that the Zurich restaurant has but thankfully it has proved to be just as amazing! The vast choice of food means that there is always something everyone can enjoy. The staff are lovely and very welcoming. Our last visit there was on the way home from New York. We arrived about 20 minutes before they opened after a night flight and not having slept for over 24 hours. And it was raining! The staff kindly let us in and brought us over some tea and we spent a really lovely morning there before heading back to Manchester with a takeaway box of food! :)Can't wait for them to open one in Manchester!!

The food is not overspiced, but each dish hasa distinct flavor. Just a great find!

The food was fab with a huge range of vegetarian and vegan choices, both hot and cold, at the buffet. The concept of paying by weight means you automatically watch how much you put on your plate allowing you to taste small amounts of lots of dishes for less than £10 without feeling like you have overeaten at the end. My one complaint would be the desserts all containing nuts bar one so if you have a nut allergy this is not ideal, not a problem with the main dishes though. Overall go and try this place - great value and great lunch!"

The restaurant is tastefully decorated with charm and style, has great outdoor seating and is situated right in the heart of London just off Regent Street. The little road that this place is on is a very upmarket and quiet street, looking around at the other restaurants and bars you'd be excused for thinking eating at Tibits would cost you a fortune, so you're happily surprised when you pay around £10 for a heaped plate.The staff are helpful and friendly, not intrusive, the wine is average priced at around£14 for the cheapest bottle.I'd happily eat here again and again, plus if you get a tastecard you can enjoy two for one prices on certain days."

The choices were varied and original, complemented well by some fantastic juices and pudding options for afterwards. Another bonus was the fact that you could eat straightaway, which though often associated with poorer quality food, wasn't the case here.The restaurant setting itself was modern and pleasant and staff were friendly and helpful. The price of the food was reasonable when considering its quality, but perhaps slightly more than you would usually pay in a primarily 'self-service' restaurant. That said, we were more than happy paying what we did for the meal, as the whole experience was a pleasant one & we would jump at the chance at returning here."

In Heddon street, just off Regent Street, in a food court, the menu choices on the boards outside certainly looked inviting to me but I warned my partner that I thought the place was probably vegetarian, as he is a meat eater. With cafe style seating and a serve yourself buffet bar, the restaurant was full of diners, so I suspect it is equally popular with both vegetarians and meat eaters. I was bowled over by the fabulous food on offer and my partner did not complain about the absence of meat. I have only once before been to a restaurant that charges for food by weight, in Cologne, and that was vegetarian too. What a fabulous idea. I am always frustrated when restricted to huge portions of just two or three options when I want to sample more that is on offer in smaller quantities, and there is plenty of hot and cold choices here.The aubergine and plum dish - what an amazing combination - and another with puy lentils in a delicious sauce, have persuaded me to buy the cook book the restaurant has published. Although this was intended as a lunch time snack I did have a satisfying plateful and all for around a fiver. The restaurant is licensed and is also open in the evening. I can hardly wait for my next visit and it won't be for a snack! Kafe"

You then take your plate to the bar, order a drink if you like, and then they weigh it, discounting your plate of course. We were charged £2.40 for 100 grm which is not cheap but the quality was excellent. No waiters, so you don't have to leave a tip. The bread was free of charge. A filling plate around £10-£12. In a lovely are just of Regent Street. Would highly recommend!! By the way if you go in the morning, or you choose take away it is £1.40 per 100 grm."

I like the fact that there is hot and cold chocolate among the drinks. In Summer, a cold chocolate is a treat. One little incident prevents me from putting 5 stars: I went with a friend who found a little piece of glass in her plate and actually broke her tooth on it. We mentioned it to the waitress who looked embarrassed but took the little piece of glass and disappeared without any feedback. It is always possible to have a problem in the kitchen and we would have understood that, but a 'sorry' would have been nice."

Downstairs was even lovelier than upstairs. The cosy 'Bedouin' ethnic style lighting continued as above alongside chandeliers and large mirrors. Gothic candles adorned each table which were large 10 seaters down to sofas and soft chairs.Once settled we went upstairs to collect our plates and start on the tour around the food serving area. The food on offer came as salad types or hot plate affairs. The choice was mouth watering!My wife and I just could not make our minds up so had a bit of most of what was on offer. My two children (13 and 15 YO) filled their plates and not a single moan was heard from either of them :o)The meal came to just over £40 including two glasses of large red wine. In London, that is great! ;o)The staff were great with us and even had time to chat and joke. None of this to busy malarky and we were so impressed we went back the following night.I would heartily recommend this place for a great evening meal and would not hesitate to give it 5 stars."

The welcome is generic and the place is charmless.

A large selection of hot and cold vegetarian cuisine is laid out on a central island unit, and you help yourself to as much as you like, before your plate is weighed at the tills. Takeaway is also available, which is presumably cheaper as the ceramic plates are replaced with lightweight polystyrene tubs.The major drawback of this place is the cost - two fairly modest plates of food and two glasses of fruit juice cost £25 - but that aside, Tibits is well worth a visit. The food is imaginative, diverse and tasty, although it could have benefitted from being a bit hotter, and that's before you spend five minutes queuing to pay for it. The ambience is good, the location is very convenient (just off Regent Street in a quirky courtyard), and the staff are helpful, based on our limited experience. It's busy, though, and they don't accept bookings, so try to get there early at lunchtime if possible."

We opted for freshly squeezed juice which was already ready made so we do not know whether the juices are bought in or made on premises. The A board outside suggested that an average plate is £6.50 bit it is more than £10, even when I was careful to avoid the heavier foods. The juices were about £4 a glass. The restaurant is pleasant. There is no service, until you approach the bar to order your drinks and pay. The place is busy; it was Sunday afternoon.

When I went there last week, one of the dishes I chose was empty so I waited a few minutes and thought perhaps I should inform the girl who was standing by the door. I did so in a friendly tone but was taken aback by the abruptness of her tone. Yes, she already knew that and had informed the kitchen, I'd have to wait as it was coming!!! I'm sorry, I said, I was only asking... She looked at me and made a face (I know, I couldn't believe it either!) and said something about not understanding me!!! I felt humiliated by this rude woman and anyway, I still had to wait about 5 more minutes for the food to come out. I didn't want this to alter my view of tibits and anyway the rest of the staff were fine, so we went back a couple of days later and had a better experience, (most probably because the rude woman wasn't there!)

Now I went to Tidbits twice, once on a date and once with a big group. It is a buffet and you pay by weight. My overall feel is 'nothing to write home about': the food was good although not very original (mixed vegetable salads, pasta etc.), and not that refined compared to some of the amazing things I've had in even the most basic vegetarian eateries, not to mention other vegetarians in London and other buffet vegetarians.Secondly, not a great place for vegans, there were many dishes along the lines of Macaroni and cheese (which I must say was quite good), vegan options were not well indicated. Finally this place is probably one of the most expensive vegetarians I've ever eaten which I guess is due to their location off of Regent street.Now the good things: central location, good atmosphere and the place has a nice modern and hip feel. If you are after 'comfort' food you will also enjoy their offers, meat-eaters should enjoy it too, finally while I like hippie vegan places it can be harder to bring different types of people there and convince them that I don't spend my days eating salads and hugging trees, I like that this place looks like any other trendy young London place. The terrace was nice in the summer and could accomodate my group of 8 people (they also had outside heaters).But really, I've been to 5 other proper vegetarian places in London and although good, this place just doesn't deserve to be first."

The food is always hugely varied, well presented and delicious, but still simple. The wine comes in huge glasses, but are charged accordingly.

You choose from a variety of fresh dishes - both salads and cooked - then pay by weight at the counter.A terrific selection of fresh drinks - I had the ginger lemonade (fresh pressed lemon with raw cane sugar and mineral water). Although we didn't choose any, perhaps worth mentioning that Tibits also serves wine, cocktails and other alcoholic drinks. This is a lovely place to meet and eat, zingy, welcoming and relaxed.

Just people who like fresh, tastful food as much as I do, without feeling guilty about hurting animals or polluting nature.Just when you think it can't get any better, wait until you have tasted the several desserts...

I have been here a few times especially when looking for a central location and in a quiet place. It's great for vegetarians and you serve yourself and pay for the food based on weight. Not the place for you if you want a posh experience. Other Heddon Street places provide that., It's buffet style with a mixture of salads, hummus, curries and then a mixture of puddings. The bar serves cocktails as well as wine and beer and there is a big are downstairs that is sometimes used for parties. Nice outdoor seating for a summer's evening. Quirky but worth a go."

Unfortunately I have 1 very serious complaint: I am a recently diagnosed diabetic and have been adivsed by my medical team not to eat anything containing sugar whilst my currently high glucose levels are bought under control. I have to not only avoid obvious things like cakes chocolate and buscuits be very aware of 'hidden' sugars in sauces etc. I asked if it was possible to be advised dishes that have addedd sugars, I was told they would call down to the kitchen and find out. I was left waiting an extremely long time during which all my friends were able to obtain and pay for their meals, in the end someone from the kitchen arrived to deal with a different matter, when I asked him what had added sugar he wasn't able to tell me. I referred back to the original serving staff member who told me some of the dressings will have sugar in, but couldn't tell me which ones. He then went on to inform me I should be ok with plain undressed salad. Considering this was my birthday treat and the price we were paying, I was not prepared to eat just plain salad. I was left standing there with no proper answer and no conclusion to my enquiry. In the end I just threw caution to the wind and ate what I fancied. Although I enjoyed my meal, my blood results that evening were high and I could only put that down to the meal at Tibits as I had eaten nothing else that evening. This is a real shame as This could have had a serious impact on my health."

The surroundings and atmosphere are also a bonus here, this is no shabby chic hippy veg outfit!

We sat outside for dinner, which is amazing in March, and then retreated inside for dessert as the evening got cooler. The little ""alley"" where it is located was very appealing with nets of small white lights hanging overhead. Another restaurant nearby had burning torches outside. It had an appealing ambience. But the main thing was the yummy food. Just excellent. It is obviously popular as all the tables on the main floor inside were occupied. We had to have our dessert on the lower level.

Many places offer a token dish or two, but you know deep down they're not keen on serving meatless meals. Ethnic restaurants are about the only places where you can get a decent variety. But at Tibits you have the salad-bar concept--all vegetarian--which means you get a wide array of dishes. It's a boon for vegans, too. The price is determined by weight. So it behooves you to walk around the huge groaning board of food before you dish up and be very selective. We made the mistake of heaping our plates and then finding even more interesting dishes down the line. Our meal for two came to £12, which is a steal in this part of London. Tibits overlooks a pretty pedestrianised lane and I'm looking forward to eating outside when the weather gets warm."

The variety of dishes is amazing, and every one that I tried was flavourful and distinctive ... well maybe the one exception was the cauliflower au gratin :-( I'm not a fan of self-service buffet, and my experience yesterday proved the point. The hot dishes were luke-warm when we ate (about 1.30pm), getting to the dishes at 1pm was a scrum so we waited until the rush died down, serving yourself was physically awkward (dishes of food were at three height levels) and I found out later that I had missed a couple of dishes which I would have liked to try. On the other hand, I also took advantage of the fact that I could select a variety of types of food in the quantities I wanted.I'm surprised at the price of £12 per meal quoted in the previous post. My wife and I each had a pretty full plate, certainly enough for a meal for each of us, for exactly half that price - £6! Obviously the previous poster eats far more than we do, and I would caution against accepting that as an average price. I had a superb large glass of Viognier for £6.50 (more than my food) which seems to me expensive ... but I did enjoy it. I went back later for an excellent dessert of Berry Cruble with cream for £3.50.We sat in the downstairs area which lacks some of the buzz and charm of the ground floor, but had the advantage of being quiet ... although be warned that the downstairs contains a children's area so it may not always be so!I think if there is one feature on which this restaurant may founder it is the lack of pay stations. There are only three, , and everyone has to pay for their food on their way to the table. When we arrived at 1pm there must have been over a dozen people in the queue, which was moving very slowly. The cashiers also serve coffee and drinks, which slows down the paying process even more. If you choose hot food, it is almost certain that it will be cold by the time you get to eat it.Notwithstanding the problems, the food is excellent, the staff charming, and the atmosphere very pleasant. Heddon Street itself is a calm oasis on the edge of the chaos and noise which is Regent Street, the whole street containing nothing but restaurants. I will certainly go back to Tibits soon, but whether or not I become a committed customer remains to be seen."

We tried delicious stuffed jalepenos, peneer curry, spinach lasagne, mini indian pastries and a selection of excellent salads. Bread is complementary too - a nice touch. My only gripe is the price. We had a tastecard which offered a two for one deal, but the bill still came to £18 for two plates of food. If I had to pay double that I would be feeling seriously ripped off.

They have an outside section as well, lovely in summer and all year for smokers (with heaters in winter -- mostly, but not in action on my last visit). Good coffee and wine."

Tibits' stuffed jalapenos are magnificent. I went there recently and was disappointed not to see any on offer. I asked the chap behind the buffet if they weren't doing them and he told me that there were some in the kitchen but he couldn't bring them out until the falafel had all gone. What a bizarre way to go about things. You can get what you want only if you're lucky with your timing. The only black mark I've ever discovered there. The falafel - unsurprisingly - was still there, untouched, when we left...Don't let this put you off though. There's always more than enough on offer to make a visit worthwhile, from the fresh bread through to the organic lager."

I was introduced to it by a friend who follows a restricted vegan diet for health reasons. It is one of the few places in London where she can be confident in finding good tasty food to suit her needs. You choose your own food from a range of hot and cold dishes, so she can see exactly what she is getting and the price depends on the weight of your plate. Simple! I liked the relaxed atmosphere which suits day or evening dining. My plate of food was less expensive than I had imagined. They sell fresh juices as well as the usual range of wines and spirits."

There was a good variety of food, this was ok but nothing special. The desserts in particular looked a bit ropey so we avoided these. The system is a bit weird - paying or a plate as you eat - which I thought wasn't practical. I would far rather have chosen / weighed what we wanted, and then been billed for this in one go at the end of the meal.We had a nice evening but I probably wouldn't return to this restaurant by choice, as there are superior vegetarian restaurants offering much better value for money IMO."

Like anybody, I like tasty food and will order the veggie option on occasions. I found this place back in March 2010 and re –visited it recently for lunch. We were a party of 3 and as we were out to enjoy ourselves set up a “tab” as we arrived – it makes life easier. They have a reasonable selection of wines at reasonable prices for central London. Remember as you serve yourself there is no ""tip"" to think about.What I really like about this place is that the food is priced by weight and you can try very small portions to find out your favourites. Afterwards you can then go back for larger portions of what you love. (You need a new plate for each visit). There is a very wide choice of hot and cold main meals plus a reasonable selection of puddings. There are lots of tasty dressings for the main meals.One of the party was vegetarian and was on a first visit. She was over the moon with the choice and standard. For a place that is bright and cheerful and offers good wholesome food at reasonable prices for central London it’s hard to beat. I will be back.ps the Absolute below zero bar is next door.....nice way to finish off an excellent lunch."

The wide variety of dish choices include Indian curry and lentils, Thai tofu, Middle Eastern houmous, tabouli and eggplant, Italian pasta, and about 30 dishes I had never seen before. There were lots of vegan choices. We heaped a mountain of food on our plates, until there was no space left, and paid about £11 each, but you'd be full with an £8 serving.

Your plate is weighed at the end and you pay based on that. You get a bread roll included so dont forget to take that off at the end when weighing your plate at the till. (We did! I was a bit annoyed because I thought they would have reminded me..)As I have the gourmet society card I got 2 for 1 on the food, which was pretty lucky as it would have been an expensive lunch otherwise. My plate was £9 and my partner's was £7. Mine was pretty full though, like I said I tried most things. I think you could have a normal portion of lunch for about £5-6. (I think there is a different rate per kilo for the evening).There is a fountain where you can get your own tap water so you're not obliged to buy a drink.Even though it's not cheap it really is worth a try, the food is such a treat I would love to have one where I live!

However do not expect to pay just peanuts ;-) One feedback for improvement though: they should better organize the services at the counter. The same person who weights the food also prepares the drink and does the billing. So, this means you can spend quite a few minutes waiting for the person to get all done... and the food will get a little cold. Why not send the guests to their table after weighting food and payment, and someone would bring the drink when it's ready?!"

A friend had recommended Tibits for something different. So curiosity got the better of us and we went to check this place out for morning coffee and homemade pastries. It was fabulous and we were so spolit for choice! Needless to say we were drawn back for lunch after seeing their amazing vegetarian hot/cold buffet.Although I am a carnivore, I had a fabulous delicious and healthy meal. We also liked the idea that you paid for your food based on weight. Definitely will recommend and return!"

The boys (teenagers) were a bit apprehensive as it is a vegetarian restaurant, but they loved it - we all did. The food is served as a buffet and you pay by weight (£1.95/100g for lunch, £2.10/100g for dinner). You can chose to eat as much or as little as you like from around 50 dishes on offer such as lentil and spinach coconut milk curry, vegetable lasagne, cheese stuffed jalapenos, spicy potato wedges, falafel crunchy bites, cantonese fried rice, apple & bell pepper goulash, roasted red pepper hoummus, various quiches, huge green olives, masses of tempting salads. Puddings on offer were plum tart, tira misu, fresh fruit and others.The restaurant is beautifully decorated and has a lovely vibe - it's the sort of place you could easily go for lunch and find yourself still there at dinner time. Some of the other diners were there for the evening like us, some had only a light meal, others were there for a drink and a few nibbles with friends after work. The staff were friendly, informative and completely unobtrusive.We all had a large plateful for our main course, followed by a dessert. The bill, including 2 soft drinks and a bottle of wine (tap water available for free from a dispenser) was £75 for the 4 of us. Amazing value, wonderful ambience and we'd definitely come again."
