It has only gotten better with time. Getting a takeaway box is also a great idea and eating it in Green Park makes for one of my favourite days out. Most of the foo dis vegan I would say and it is very clearly signposted as to what is and what isn't. After a few visits you get the hang of not mixing up your food if you don't want - I even put dessert and main dishes in my takeaway box and they end up fine. Very tasty food and it may be slightly expensive but totally worth it. The heavier foods do end up costing more but they should fill you up more so there is logic in their pay for what you take system as this also reduces waste and it isn't poor quality buffet food anyway. The juices are also great although I would always recommend the passionfruit lemonade.

It is at this counter that you can order drinks. My daughter and I ordered lattes on the Saturday. My daughter's soy latte was made and she took our plates out to the patio table. I was waiting a bit so I asked the barista serving us if she could bring my latte out when it was done as I didn't want my food to get cold. She said that she was on her own so she couldn't do that. Then, another waitress behind the counter saw me standing there and asked if I needed a tray. I said that I was just waiting for my latte. She very kindly offered to bring my drink out when it was done which I very much appreciated. I must have chosen about 12 different things for my lunch (a little bit of this; a little bit of that!) on both days. It was really fun to try so many things!When my daughter and I ate there on Saturday, our two plates and two lattes cost 30 pounds."

My friend got a full plate with a drink and his came to £23. Therefore if your not a big eater then this could be a nice plalce to dine. The first thought is the restaurant is really nice, the plates are heavy and the choice of vegeterian food is awesome. I like that that there were lot's of new and familar items that you could mix and match to fill your plate it is definately more exciting than a standard restaurant. I liked the food all of it was tasty and would definately go again."

The hot food is basically 'fast food' and the cold dishes look nice but when mixed on your plate taste all the same watery vinegar and you might end up with upset stomach as we have experienced. If food stand there long time and I can only think what bacteria levels are when lots of people nibble the food. Also when you go to weigh your cocktail of food, it is overpriced referring to ingredients used. For a vegan desserts are dull, soya based, not a great culinarist experience. The staff knowledge about veganism is poor, and I hear that only one staff member in the whole place is vegetarian. When I ask if they prepare the food for the buffet every morning, I get the answer that only some of the dishes are cooked freshly same day. After two times disappointment, I think I really appreciate when going to traditional veggie restaurant and ordering my tasty choice plus even paying less for that. I would rather go to little restaurant where the staff has seemingly a passion for vegan or vegetarian lifestyle than have a chain experience leaving half of my food on the side."

You can expect all the usual plentiful variety of healthy vegetarian and vegan dishes, served as buffet style and paid for by weight that there are in the or gunslinger restaurant off regent street. The weight based system does unfortunately mean the price of a single price of food can be eye-wateringly high if you want to try lots of dishes different dishes (which you should as there are so many delicious things to chose from) so come prepared to spend around £20 on a full plate of food. Obviously the heavier food items end up costing more so you can try to be strategic in your choices. When I came there was a special half price opening offer on and it's a shame they don't do these promotions more frequently as I would definitely come more often if it was a bit cheaper. However there also does need to be recognition that healthy whole foods do tend to cost more and everything is freshly made and delicious so you won't regret the splurge. The staff are lovely and friendly, the restaurant is bright and airy and if you still have room after dinner they do a great selection of deserts and cakes including plenty of vegan options.

They are more common in continental Europe, and I think this is where Tibits comes from. And not only is it self-service, but it's vegetarian too. So it's a whole new concept for London, and I think it works by and large.It's certainly a very nice space in a good location - in the Heddon Street courtyard just off Regent Street, and it has lots of outside seating space which is a welcome addition in London.Customers help themselves from an extensive buffet of (mostly) cold food with a few hot dishes. I would have liked a bit more labelling of ingredients to help me to choose dairy-free options, and certainly more hot dishes would have been welcomed. But to be fair it was a hot summer day, so maybe the restaurant does more hot food when the weather is colder.Having made their choices, customers then have to go up to the counter to have their food weighed, and also order drinks there and pay. So, it's totally self-service. I'm not sure whether some British people will find that a bit odd - it's too much like a motorway service station and the horrors therein. A bit more service might be needed - and making sure customers are not eating from the buffet, which we saw happen.The place was clean as were the toilets. Staff are pleasant, although one waitress that we asked for drinks looked rather alarmed and explained we needed to go to the tills to order.Prices are reasonable for central London."

That was it, so I asked did we pay by the gram and he responded no it will be by the plate.The queue was so long to pay that the hot food was cold by the time we sat down to eat. Staff were totally blank with no interaction and sad faces, food was very vinegary and lacked the great flavours my wife creates with her vegan meals.

Everything is clearly marked as vegetarian or vegan. You take a plate and start filling it. Then you go to the cash register, they weigh your plate, and you pay by weight. I believe it's 28 pounds per kg. So you don't know in advance how much your meal will cost, but you get a chance to try a variety of dishes. I filled my my plate without piling it, and ended up paying 12.40 pounds. Perfectly reasonable.There's also a water fountain free of charge.The place was pretty crowded and noisy at dinner time on a weekday, and people kept walking around between the food boat and the register, so not the best atmosphere. Perhaps better for grabbing a quick vegan or vegetarian meal."

The last visit ( 2 weeks ago) was particularly unpleasant for me because of the lady at the counter. I wonder if she worked in a prison canteen in the past. Good selection of vegetarian and vegan food but I find it overpriced (even my 11 year old son's plate was well over their advertised £10 per plate).We paid 40 for 3 plates and no drinks. You get as much service as you'd get in Itsu or Wasabi but at least in these places the staff are always friendly. However, if you have a choice of where you'd plan to eat in central London, you're probably better off at Mildred's (Soho) where a £12 will leave you very full.

The food was very tasty, nothing to complain about on that front whatsoever. The main issue was that it was difficult to actually get any food, and once you had the food it was difficult to pay for it, so it was cold by the time you got to the table. Perhaps this was just because the Tuesday night offering is very popular? But there was almost no hot food left at the salad bar, and it was only 6:30pm. Occasionally a very relaxed looking chef brought out a plate of new rice, but they failed to re-stock the main warm dishes, the spiced cauliflower or one of the curries, which mean that there was a massive queue around the food bar. Once we finally got a bit of food and headed to the tills, there were three staff members faffing behind the bar who didn't seem to notice the long line of people waiting to pay. It took a good few minutes before they turned aronund from chatting to actually take payment, which meant the food was cold by the time we got to the table. So overall, good food, but bad service from the kitchen and the till staff. What a shame."

There were four adults and two babies, they brought us high-chairs and had seated us downstairs in the quieter section. There's even a kids corner with books and toys. You rarely find a central London restaurant so kid friendly. Even so, the atmosphere was calm and there weren't many kids. Also I'm claustrophobic and normally hate sitting downstairs in windowless rooms but there was a huge skylight! Really nice.Now the food:Yes it is expensive for what you're getting. Since you pay by weight then if you fill your plate with potato wedges and rice which don't cost much to make and aren't exactly fine dining, then you'll be annoyed when it comes to fifteen quid. But if you get gorgeous little helpings of baba ganoush, delicate curries and pickles and coleslaws then it seems ok for the price. The African peanut pumpkin curry was amazing.Also they don't make you pay for bread rolls and you take them off your plate before weighing it so if you want to fill up on carbs alongside your fancy feast then use bread; not wedges!The desserts were wonderful. My partner is a vegan and hasn't had dessert in a restaurant in such a long time! But they have lovely creamy vegan desserts and loads of normal veggie ones too. He had sticky toffee pudding with vegan vanilla cream. I had banoffee pie and it was great.We luckily missed the queue because we were so early but by the time we were leaving a huge queue was forming to pay for plates. The coffee was very nice too."

It was my 2nd attempt at visiting as the first time was a Saturday afternoon around 4 weeks previous and it was very busy. Unfortunately I will not be returning to this Restaurant.I had what amounted to 2 bits of broccoli quiche, a couple of wedges, a couple of onion rings, a dollop of babaganoush and a spoon of potato Salad. I almost had a heart attack when the items came to £14.10In a similar class of restaurant, for that type and portion of food I would have thought around 6 or 7 pounds would have been a reasonable maximum cost.I understand that the restaurant has a central London location, and has a weigh method of pricing, but if i was not hungry I would have asked the guy at the till if he was joking and changed my mind. Total rip off, unbelievable. I felt robbed and I'm just glad i did not go through the same horror mixed with a massive que to get served. The food was average and I have had a much better meal at Mildreds Vegetarian Restaurant close by at less cost and better service and none of the que up with your plate to pay drama.I think for the cost of £14.10 it should have been an all you can eat buffet. I''m baffled at how much you charge for a bit of broccoli quiche with wedges and salad.Don't go there expecting good value nice food, but do expect to be frustrated if you are hungry and have to que to weigh and pay."

Some of the dishes are staples for some people, but for others they are ho-hum (or off-limits like the high carb potatoes and rice items). I thought of going for breakfast, but found out that there are no hot dishes for breakfast, That's a shame. There ought to be, including eggs."

It was also great to be in the heart of London so we could visit shops and art galleries nearby too. One of the group is vegetarian so we wanted to accommodate her requirements. Although a carnivore, I love good vegetarian food and that is what I found here. The food was delicious and there was a great selection. I liked the idea of paying by weight and I think we enjoyed good value for our money. The atmosphere upstairs was buzzing but downstairs was rather dull and you had to go upstairs to collect your food and drink. The one criticism I have is that we took the trouble to book a table and found ourselves downstairs, which was very disappointing and didn't match our expectations. Apparently they always put bookings downstairs, which isn't very friendly when one has taken the trouble to book! We complained to the waiter who was very helpful and found us a perfect table by the window upstairs. I would definitely go there again, as would my friends, but would request a table upstairs."

It's a big space in central London. It's self-service with lots of veggie options and a large drinks list. As such, it offers great flexibility in case, say, one of you wants to eat but others just want drinks and vice versa. It hits all the spots in terms of a venue that suits a variety of tastes and needs.Despite being a large venue, it's almost always full, near capacity. Prices are determined by the weight of food on your plate. I have to say, I do find it abut pricey. No matter how carefully I load my plate, I pay an average of £15 each time, but all things considered, it's good spot to eat and chat. There's a fair amount of outdoor space and two floors of seating. Other points of interest: Just across from the restaurant is a plaque in honour of David Bowie. It's the location where the cover to his 'Ziggy Stardust Spiders from Mars' album was shot."

Very well worth a visit even if you're not a veggie."

Pay for what you serve :),"Okay, so I LOVED the food here - agree with many others in that it is a bit pricey, but totally worth it - especially if you know how much you eat and can portion out accordingly as you only pay for what you serve yourself - by the weight.My only real issue here, and hence the average score, was that the staff was SUPER rude. This rarely if ever happens at a place like this, and was turned off by it upon walking into the place and being shoved to the side by the first worker at the door. We asked to be seated at a table/booth and were told there were none available and were seated at the window, which seats much like a bar where you are next to whomever you are with, etc. and facing outwards, tight space, etc. I was fine with this and thought, okay cool - no big deal, must be busy - then went to go ask where the bathroom was (it was POURING.. it's LONDON) so that I could wash my hands and such - and again, poor staff interaction. Anyhow, found the bathroom downstairs, and there I found that there were PLENTY of tables available, open and many others were coming to be seated w/o reservation after I'd just asked .. I went about my way and just had a bad vibe after that.Not sure if it was just the specific staff that night, but overall - turned me off to the idea of returning to spend so much money to be treated so poorly.But - again, the food was good - so you can test your luck ! xx"

It's not actively bad in any way, but ending up with a plate of brown rice, some very delectable falafel, good humous and a few salads is not my idea of vegetarian heaven. Even the nuts and fried onions that would have perked everything up had gluten in them. (I'm imagining Tibits used soy sauce instead of the more expensive but gluten free tamari. But then they have Mayfair rent to pay.) I will say I was with a party of 12 and I was the only one who wasn't raving about the food, but then the rest of them can eat gluten and/or like curry. Also, the lychee martini's are fab.

However, pick the wrong ones, your appetite won't be anywhere near sated and you'll need to remortgage the house.It really is my only criticism of this establishment.A set price for a plate full (even it was £15) would be far better than the laborious guesswork and fear that is associated with your selections.But being off Regent Street (Heddon Street is becoming a little food mecca these days) it's great for a drop in and if you ask the staff (if you can find one), I'm sure they'll advise on the best selections to get the best price.The seating outside is an added bonus for a balmy autumn evening and their licenced too, if you don't want to be too healthy.In truth it should be on every Vegetarian/Vegan/ Healthy eaters go to list.But just watch those portion sizes."

It's a self-serve buffet affair where you take as much as you want and then pay by the weight of the food on the plate. The choice of food is quite extensive, with warm and cold dishes and salads from various parts of the world, some more plain, some more spicy. Everything is fresh and tasty and all sorts of combinations seem to work well. There are also some nice-looking desserts (although I didn't try any last time) and a juice bar with a wide array of options.I really like the feeling of having eaten a meal which is fresh and healthy, not to mention tasty, and this place certainly ticks those boxes very well."

See you back soon.",>,Favorite Veggie Spot in London,"After a trip to London last year I made it a point to revisit this restaurant on my trip this year. The location is a little bit hard to find, near Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus on a very narrow side street. Once you turn the corner you find a charming little side street with a few restaurants including my favorite, Tibits. As a vegetarian, when I'm traveling there are a few things I look for when dining just due to sheer time including, speed, quality, choice and selection. For vegetarians or vegans, this isn't always as easy. The large chains in London have some healthier selections, but not many choices. Lots of dairy as well.Tibits is a buffet style restaurant that provides multiple choices for your meal. The day I visited they had this delicious soy crumble flatbread, lasagnas, various pasta dishes, potatoes, many salads, yummy toffee pudding and several other dessert choices, and many other ethic foods available. If you just want to make a fresh, hearty salad with some tofu cubes, you can do that too. Just like any other buffet, you weigh your choices and pay by weight. Mine was around $12USD, which is comparable if not better than your average Whole Foods hot meal buffet and way more tasty. This style is fast, healthy, and provides a lot of choices for your meal, which is ideal. They have a variety of coffee/tea drinks available as well and nice indoor and outdoor seating.I'll always make a point to visit, really checks off all the boxes and was my favorite meal of the trip yet again. Thank you Tibits!"

It is a self service buffet where you pay for food by weight. All the food is vegetarian and some is vegan and there are hot dishes just as vegetable stew with rice and cold dishes -a huge variety of salads, hummus, etc . The food is quite health conscious which is why it was a surprise to see the not as healthy but very tasty desserts- apple crumble, sticky toffee pudding and tiramisu. There is a good choice of drinks, hot, cold, alcoholic, non alcoholic. It is suitable for all ages and all appetite sizes."

We liked the idea that they weigh your food and that determines the price, so you are in control of how much food you eat. There is a variety of dishes to choose from and there is a clear labelling system so you can immediately tell whether a certain dish is vegan, gluten-free, has dairy products, has eggs etc. Every dish we tried was dekicious, I particularly liked the turkish pide, the frittata, the salads (especially green beans and nuts and greek salad). Everything is tasty, perhaps slightly too oily hence a 4 instead of a 5. I will definitely come back."

As a vegan, I am used with few and boring options. At Tibits, I often found myself confused between so many great choices and wanted to try them all. Most of the times I ended up loving dishes that I wouldn't even try in other places.Totally worth the visit for vegans, vegetarians, and even meat eaters who wants to experiment new things :)"

We took it in turns to go up and serve ourselves. I went first and really struggled to find simple salads and lower calorie options. They served guacamole, houmous and other dips but no corn chips to dip into them. There are plenty of desserts and creamy curries, chips, and oily rice dishes. I had to laugh when the table next to me had the same struggle as me and opted for small plates of potato wedges and a pint of beer each with agreement that they would go somewhere else for their main. Mocktails were ok but again packed full of sugar. The staff changed dishes while people were trying to serve themselves and walked in front of customers holding plates. They didn't make eye contact and it was painfully obvious that none of them enjoyed being there."

It's all veggie and you can eat as much as you want, you simply pay per kilo, and it's all veggie! We'd been a couple of time before last night's visit. We particularly liked the risotto and the dhal. The gluten salad was great too. However, my girlfriend found a little piece of stone in the fried okra. Fortunately she didn't break her tooth but she hurt a tooth whilst chewing.The staff offered her to refill her plate but she felt that there was no point and that most importantly she wanted someone to react on the fact that there could have been more of these stones in the food and that someone else could really hurt themselves. She asked to speak to the manager who only turned up 10 minutes later. His answer was very poor as he first tried to explain that the stone was part of the okra... He then said that eventually it could have been a very hard piece of bread even though what she chewed was a far more solid than that. I could not even slice it with my knife... Anyway, we were a bit disappointed to see that at no point he considered the potential hazard/safety issue. We understand that this was unusual and it would have been fine to recognise that, rather than being told that we were wrong. In the end he offered us desserts but frankly we were not really in the mood for these anymore..."

Walking past Tibits I thought that looks good, I'll try it - without realising it was a veggie restaurant.

The young waitress asked if I had ever tried proper vegan meal and if not, then why not at least try it. So I did, and was very pleasantly surprised that I really enjoyed it.

It's a great and welcome concept within a nice enough ambience and hurrah for it being vegetarian. However, £14 for a barely filled plate is ridiculously expensive. I want a) a larger quantity of food at that price or b) much better quality. If it was all you can eat for a fixed price then yay or half the price. The food itself could just muster an okay from me. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything to celebrate. Despite me having a bit of everything, it all tasted the same to me. Also a lot of the food I thought was warm was actually refrigerated.Another negative is when busy there's quite a queue to pay for your food so it gets cold quick whilst you're waiting. And again maybe the price would be okay if there was anything resembling a service but we had to wait a good few minutes to be seen and then it wasn't explained to us what we then had to do. ie get a plate; choose the food; take to the bar to be weighed and paid.And now...
