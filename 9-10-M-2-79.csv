Grilled Roman Artichoke starter,Date of visit: August 2020,Grilled Roman Artichoke starter was incredible! Lovely even spent here for my birthday and dined al fresco thanks to COVID which was surprisingly great too! Highly recommend for vegans in London!
Amazing Veggie & Vegan menu,Date of visit: August 2020,"Visiting London for the weekend, The food was amazing, so good we’ve booked to go back again the next night, great choice of cocktails, the Spiced Pineapple Negroni was perfectly balanced. Very friendly staff and very covid safe."
Love love love!!,Date of visit: August 2020,Have always loved Mildred's and was so happy to visit post-lockdown. The food is just as fantastic and all the appropriate measures are in place to keep everyone safe.
Lunch,Date of visit: July 2020,"Came here for lunch after researching on google for vegetarian/vegan restaurant in soho to take my bf as he is vegetarian. The restaurant itself it’s a pretty place and the menu sounds interesting. We had a couple of main courses which were ok. My bf ordered kebab skewers. Those consisted in a few pieces of grilled vegetarian chicken and onion. Problem was the onion-chicken ratio wasn’t balanced at all. Therefore he didn’t enjoy it much as he doesn’t like onions. I am pretty sure it wasn’t specified on the menu, otherwise he would have chosen something else. My curry was nice thou. The sauce was rich and it was cooked really well. There was a crunchy element as well, it added a nice kick.Service was alright, they told us that the restaurant was busier then expected, but we didn’t wait long for our drinks/food and neither to pay. I’d say that, for what we had, the price is slightly on the high side. I am sure that a vegetarian/vegan person would enjoy this place very much, thou it didn’t really impress us. Said that, I would give it another try, it might have been just bad luck. I really enjoyed my curry."
Delicious,Date of visit: July 2020,Went here for my partner’s birthday. Excellent service throughout. Either order the old-fashioned way with the server or via the new online system. Both work very well.The food was delicious as ever and a very good choice. The new reservation system is also appreciated rather than the old system of simply turning up and hoping for a table.

Maybe a bit steep in price overall but for the restairant experience and the quality of the food i was happy. The venue is situated in the heart of Camden High Street and is very spacious and has seat externally aswel. Menus included in photosThey can cater for your needs as they did for me explained that I cpuldnt eat certain foods snd they removed from and didnt include while cooking.
Food is incredibly delicious!,"<img src=""https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1b/9c/2c/5b/photo0jpg.jpg""  class=""centeredImg noscript"" style="" min-width:70px; "" width=""100%""data-mediaid=""463219803"" /> >",Food is incredibly delicious! Friendly staff and a very cosy place. I’ll pay it a visit again very soon. Highly recommended.
Incredible delicious starters and main,Date of visit: March 2020,"We were three and had four starters: the mushroom balls (porcini arancini, white truffle oil, porcini, chestnut mushroom risotto on porcini cream); the hazelnut dukkah (warm heirloom carrots, orange dressing, whipped tahini, soft herbs, pomegranate); the gyoza dumplings (shimeji mushrooms, chilli bean oil & tamara dip), the charred artichokes (with crostini and aioli); the mole frijoles, tomatillo salsa, greek style vegan 'cheese', corn chips and one main: the levant chicken kebabs served with Persian lime butterbeans, fennel, preserved lemon, spinach and whipped tahini.Plentiful and all succulent. All the starters we chose ranged in price between 5 and 6 GBP and the main was 12 GBP.Great competition to Farmacy which I place at the top because Famacy goes a step further understanding that processed white sugar is the most unhealthy ingredient one could put in desserts. Unfortunately, Milfred’s does use white processed sugar in their desserts. Hopefully they will change for the healthy option in the near future!However their starters and mains are incredibly delicious."
Great food!,Date of visit: February 2020,We visited on February 5th 2030 for my brother’s birthday and had a great time. The food was delicious (especially the red velvet brownie) and hospitality great as always.It’s w shame that you have had to close for now due to the current situation but we will definitely return when you are able to re-open.
Sunday Lunch Perfection,Date of visit: March 2020,"A rainy trip to London was made very bearable by the delicious, ethical fare; outstanding service and cosy ambience of the wonderful Mildred's. I introduced a 'hippie' friend on this occasion, who was incredibly impressed and loathe to leave whilst she could continue to feast her senses by regarding every plate served to adjacent tables!We had mains of fake duck buns, sides of sweet potato fries and dessert of orange pistachio cake with orange sorbet; as well as the chocolate cherry lava cake. I am salivating as I recall the tastes and textures...Service was provided by a handsome, consumate, funny and attentive gentleman.Bill was around £50. Perfect."
,,
"Great food, every time",Date of visit: February 2020,"We are based oversee but always ensure we get to go to Mildred's when in London. The food always hit the spot (including for non-vegetarians like me), nice selection of wines and beers to go with the regular changing menu. The dishes take inspiration form dishes all over the world, adding the restaurants own touch to it."
Amazing - good for group as well as small tables,Date of visit: March 2020,"i just wanted to promote their ability to deal with large groups. We took over their lovely private dining room on Friday night (it can fit 14 people) and they were so accommodating, Food was excellent (as ever) and service with a smile.One to keep in mind if you need to book a big table in the future."
Worth the wait,Date of visit: February 2020,"First of all, we had to put our names down and were said that they table will be ready in an hour. We went for a walk around and around 20 mins later got the text that our table was already ready!It’s quite noisy there bc the place itself is not very big so everyone is sitting super close. However, the food was so worth it! Everything was top notch and if it’s something you like - the ‘meat’ tastes just like the real deal!"
Incredible Food,Date of visit: January 2020,"the food here was incredible. i'm not a vegan, and was interested to try things like vegan cheese for the first time. everything was so flavoursome.You have to wait a good while for a table but its absolutely worth it. really friendly staff too."
Delicious,Date of visit: February 2020,"The place was very busy, but to our surprise they had extra seating upstairs and could accommodate 3 of us without booking. We enjoyed delicious vegan food with a great choice, especially because I’m the only veggie. Dessert was yummy. Good atmosphere and attentive staff. Will definitely return. Good value too."
Can't fault this restaurant in any way.,Date of visit: February 2020,Had a great evening with my family here. As a non veggie surrounded by veggie youth I'm used to seeing the lack of choice often given to them. The food and the service was excellent. Went for the Polish burger which was fantastic. The queuing system is great and allowed us to pop out to a local boozer (The Old Coffee house) before being seated.
Amazing experience,Date of visit: February 2020,This is my favourite restaurant in London. Such a great welcome. Feel right at home here! What an amazing team and delicious food. My go to place in Soho!
Just as good as twenty years ago,Date of visit: February 2020,"First visit since the mid 90s. I’ve literally not forgotten some of the food I had over twenty years ago, and the food today was just as good. Mostly vegan (which is a nice change), great selection, and all the food was really brilliant. I just wish we could visit more often."
Everything tasted really good - and was well served,Date of visit: February 2020,"Having been to Mildreds in Dalston I had high expectations of the Soho branch - and I was not disappointed.I was the guest of a former colleague and his wife, both Veggies from out of town, to whom I had recommended this as a different experience - they were bowled over.We each chose different dishes as starters and mains and each said we had chosen well - no-one was the slightest disappointed.Yes - it is small and a bit noisey but the food and service more than compensates for that.Would I go again - as a non-Veggie - YES! Who needs meat when the alternative is so good? Not me."
"Buzzy, noisy, and yummy",Date of visit: February 2020,Quaint vegetarian restuarant. Very small premises and tables are qutie squashed. Full and buzzy but conversation was difficult as the noise levels were high. Service was graceful and speedy. Food was really nice - lots of variety and good vegetarian fare. Worth a visit - ideally at a quieter time - but the popularity of this little hideway will make that quite a challenge.
,,
Fabulous pre-theatre meal!,Date of visit: February 2020,"You don’t need to be vegetarian to eat here - the food and atmosphere are great. We went for a pre-theatre meal and it was perfect!No booking, and always busy so either go early or be prepared to queue - everyone went away raving about it!"
excellent food and dessert,Date of visit: February 2020,"Neither me nor my boyfriend are vegans, but we visited earlier today and we were really impressed. We loved the food, and especially the dessert (caramel cheesecake...). It didn't take long time before we got what we ordered, and the employees were nice. The only thing that lowered our impression was one waitress forgetting that we ordered another drink. We also got some bread and olives at our table, and we thought it was served based on pure courtesy, but when we got the check we had to pay for that as well. It was maybe just a misunderstanding, and maybe the bread and the olives ended up at the wrong table, I don't know. Either way, I still ended up having a really good evening."
Good vegan in an excellent,>,Good vegan in an excellent little restaurant - not my first visit. Not my last one either. The place is larger than it thought and includes upstairs. Up it is more quiet and cosy but still good service. At bit disappointed with my Bowl. Next time I will choose the burgers
Lovely place- impressed!,Date of visit: February 2020,Group of 4 of us (non of us vegan) visited Saturday night and we were very impressed. Great service and good atmosphere but most of all the food was all really good. Good overall value for money too including drinks. Definitely recommend it and hopefully get to go back next time we are in London.
Lovely anniversary dinner,Date of visit: February 2020,"My partner and myself went to Mildred's for the first time as a little anniversary treat. Everything was delicious and the atmosphere was buzzing! The service was fab, the bar staff recommend a wine that was just perfect for me. The no-duck in the baguette was so amazing and the noodle dish I had was divine. This place definitely suitable for vegetarians, vegans and Omni's and I assure you won't miss the lack of meat. Decent price for a tasty dinner too, £50 for two starters, two mains and two drinks, including service charge and a tip. We will be back soon!"
What a great place - give it a try,Date of visit: January 2020,We ate here as a reasonably large group in the private dining room. Admittedly most of us were not vegans but we were all absolutely delighted by the experience. The dishes on offer were superb. Excellent selection of cocktails and desserts too. Great service.What I would say is that it is very popular and they don’t have a booking policy apart from the private dining room. We ate early on a Thursday evening but as we were going in the door people were coming out saying that was a 1.5 hour wait.
Fab vegan food in London,>,What amazing food ! There are quite a few choices here too. I had the Thai curry and definitely will go back for more !
Best food we had on our London Trip,>,My daughter and I went to this fabulous restaurant in Soho last week when we were in London. My daughter is a vegetarian but I’m not. I could not believe how good the food was! If only we had found this great restaurant at the beginning of our trip we would of went back several times. I loved the food because it was flavorful and tasted homemade. Even the dessert was excellent. We had the blood orange pistachio cake with orange sorbet. Yum! If you are looking for some fantastic food and great service this is the place to go!
Above par!,>  >,"Absolutely above par! Such a great concept for the modern millennial. As a couple of friends and I were doing veganuary/dry Jan, this was the perfect choice for a catch up dinner. Luckily we got in early and out our name on the wait list and also managed to get a seat in the waiting area. Within 15 minutes the queue for a table was heaving but it was a nice atmosphere and as there’s plenty of seating space the queue moved pretty quickly. We were welcomed with a dry January drinks menu to our delight! Once we were seated the service was casual yet efficient. Food was fantastic. We had gnocchi, a ‘chicken’ burger and ‘duck’ bahn mis. The flavours were phenomenal, enjoyed every single bite! Drinks were also a hit. Would highly recommend."
Lovely vegetarian restaurant,Date of visit: January 2020,I have been meaning to try this place for ages and it did not disappoint. A mid week lunch time was very busy but we were quickly seated and served with wonderful bean and parsnip sausage and mash and a beetroot burger. Having been a fan of Cranks years ago I feel this is a great alternative which is not Asian food A smart if small venue in Soho .
,,
Absolutely loved it! 🙂,>  >  >,Absolutely loved it! Been vegetarian for 30 years and started vegan this month. The food is lush and the desserts are to die for. Love ambience and the service. Would really recommend.
Vegan birthday celebration,Date of visit: January 2020,"Great experience. 4 of us went there to celebrate my vegan daughter's 19th. Only 1 vegan amongst us all. We shared starters of the gyosas and the arancine balls. The arancinis where lovely - a winner and we should have ordered more of them. Gyosas were just ok. Mains where all good. Chick'n kebabs, sri lankan curry and 2 burgers with chips (teriyaki chick'n and beetroot). We all had a taste of each other's food but we all agreed that all the food was lovely. I had the beet burger and it is was very satisfying. And the Chick'n burger and kebabs had the consistency of real chicken. Who would have thought!! And the curry was nice and creamy and coconutty. We shared desserts, 1 cheesecake and a clementine cake. The cheesecake was wonderful but I would not order the clementine cake again. No-one liked it . 2 diet cokes and a carafe of wine. With service included it came to £118 which was fair value. The place was busy (Sunday afternoon) and on arrival we gave them our mob number and went to nearby pub for a drink. Within half an hour we received a text and the table was waiting for us. Staff were efficient , polite and knowledgeable. No problems whatsoever and as a meat eater I was pleasantly surprised. Would go again. Thoroughly recommend this place."
A vegan hot spot,>,"Mildred's offers a varied and interesting menu which is a delight to discover as a vegan. The food was delicious, well presented and the portions are generous. We didn't have to wait long for our food either. (The drinks menu is also well varied and I thoroughly appreciated the fact the wine list is organic). Despite the fact this Mildred's establishment doesn't take bookings, we only had to wait about 5 mins to be seated. The restaurant is incredibly narrow and cramped though so definitely not ideal if you come with a pushchair/wheelchair etc. But for a girls dinner it was fine. The decor was quirky and the staff friendly. I do think the drinks are considerably overpriced but the food is definitely value for money. Recommend to all vegans!! (But get there early to avoid disappointment. We arrived at 17:00 and left at about 18:30 and the queue outside was enormous as we were leaving). It's also very close to the theatres in Leicester square and so is an ideal vegan spot for pre-show supper."
Outstanding,Date of visit: January 2020,"Excellent service, delicious food and reasonable prices.A paradise in London for vegans. The location is also quite convenient: very central but not too busy. Highly recommend it."
Quality veggie meal,Date of visit: January 2020,"Very good food, I went yesterday around 15:30 and even then it was busy! I had the burger, fries and drink option which was £15.00 and good value in my book. They are currently doing vegan only for January but in general it is a vegetarian restaurant."
Vegan date night in Soho,Date of visit: December 2019,"Vegan review - Winner! Mildreds is a small room with low lighting, quirky art and big flavours! Walked in for dinner and got seated within minutes. The servers were busy but effective. Food tasted so good - I had a ""chicken"" skewer that was so meat-like, so juicy and satisfying. Also enjoyed a creative mocktail. Really can't think of anything bad to say, this one is well worth trying out if you can."
Really lovely,Date of visit: January 2020,Finally made it to Mildreds - pre theatre meal - arrived 5.30 ish and got seated right away upstairs as downstairs already full. Fairly quickly the room filled up. As we were leaving about 7 ish there were long waits I think. The Pear Martini packs a punch . We decided to go for it and had starters and mains. There was not one dish we didn’t love - two of us has the levant chick n kebabs and thought it was the best fake chicken we ve tried. One very happily fed family.
Hope it's still going well Mildreds !,Date of visit: May 2019,"Forgot to post this review in May when Mildred's opened, apologies. We had a great meal there, fab service on day 1, a bit of a squeeze inside but good ambiance. Got to come back :-)"
Pre theatre gluten free and veggie delight,>  >,"We visited Mildreds after finding on Trip advisor, arrived earlier than we would have liked because they do not take reservations which is a little inconvenient, we did not wait for a table (4.30 pm) and had a seat in an upstairs room which was nice and cosy, the starters were amazing and main courses ok but not so much choice for coeliacs, we would probably go again but not if we had a theatre reservation in case there was a long wait for a table or in our case found ourselves eating a little earlier than we would have liked, all in all a great place to eat thank you"
"Mildred, not Dreadmill!",>,"As always, great food and ambience on the ground level which had a different look and feel compared to the last time we visited the place. We were told the wait would be an hour and twenty minutes but we're seated within half an hour. The place could do with managing the waiting customers better - lots of bumping into staff and other customers. We got a table on the upper level, which weren't as swish as the ground level. The table was very wobbly too start with and we had to constantly hold it in place with our feet. Coming to the main agenda for the evening - the food! The menu was all vegan to celebrate Veganuary which was perfect. As always, it was great! What Mildred does exceedingly well is the consistency in its food! The Sri Lankan curry was divine as always. We tried the Porcini Mushroom Arancini, Gyoza Dumplings, Harissa Bravas and the Levant Chick'n Kebabs too. The Arancini and Harissa Bravas were at par with the Sri Lankan curry. The mushroom sauce with the Arancini was flavourful and the Harissa Bravas was hot and spicy. Levant Kebabs were too dry, could do with a bigger generous doze of the butter bean sauce. Finally for dessert, the cheesecake and sticky toffee pudding were simply delicious! Will go back for just the desserts soon! All in all great dinner with friends but found it slightly pricey as the ambience doesn't match the beautiful food being served. Could do with a bit of an upgrade in the ambience department and a slightly affordably priced menu would always be welcomed. Wonder if they do a set menu!"
,,
Consistently good food,Date of visit: December 2019,"On this visit my friend is vegan, the other two of us being neither vegan nor vegetarian. I have been to Mildred’s a few times now and never feel I’m missing out. The food is so good and I enjoy it very much. We also had my granddaughter with us and they readily produced a high chair for her. The service is very good too. The restaurant is quite small and the tables are close together. I will definitely return."
Never have I...,Date of visit: December 2019,"eaten vegetarian food that was so delicious and imaginative. I've been vegetarian for a very long time but my teenage girls are recent converts. Usually, I would go for Chinese and Indian food but this takes vegetarianism and veganism to a different level. Girls had the Halloumi burgers which they said were divine.The husband and I shared three starters, -harrissa bravas, herb roast potatoes, harrissa, aioli-porcini arancini, white truffle oil, porcini, chestnut mushroom risotto, porcini cream- artichokes -halloumi, red onion, harissa, charred red pepper, romaine lettuce, tahini, pita breadService was excellent. It gets very busy so I guess best to book in advance, we were lucky to get a table as we went in just before 12.00.The food came quickly and our waitress was very attentive.The few trolls who wrote bad reviews or average reviews here are being mean little creatures."
Great sorbet but a bit bland for savoury dishes,>  >  >  >,I liked the spicy halloumi with beetroot but I was expecting way more spice. Flavour were nice but it could be turned up a lot more. My main was not that great. The beetroot burger was dry and did not have much flavour. I could not taste the clementine in the clementine cake but the blood orange sorbet was absolutely delicious!!!!!
Pre theatre vegan dining,Date of visit: December 2019,"Get there early to avoid the rush... There is no pre booking but the service is fast but not in a rushed way. Hugo ran the front of house very well, almost convinced him to join us for a glass of the Riesling he recommended!Not a huge menu but everything is delicious. (Last night was my 3rd visit so I've tried most of the menu)... great to share between 2 or 3 so you can try more."
Vegetarian Vegan Sublime,>,"This place is a vegetarian’s dream! The food is sublime and affordable for us who haven’t got the disposable income for swanky prices. The staff are fabulous and even though you’re likely to have a wait as you can’t book and it’s always busy, it’s worth the wait! Every course was a delight and the ingredients and vegetable cookery is sensational! Can’t wait to revisit. My partner is a fussy vegetarian who’s allergic to cheese and mushrooms and for once this was absolutely no problem at all. It is refreshing and almost emotional to discover such a truly authentic and ethical foody adventure venue. Thank you Mildreds"
Very Busy,Date of visit: December 2019,Loved being able to pick everything from a card for once. As a vegetarian it is sometimes difficult to find something at restaurants. The place is extremely busy! We had a waiting time of about 50'. We were able to leave our phone number and the staff sent a text as soon as a table was free.
"Basic food, poor service.",Date of visit: December 2019,"Basic food, poor service. Was full of expectations after seeing such good reviews, however reality didn’t live up to it."
"Healthy, tasty, affordable",>,"While I’m far from a vegetarian, I love mildreds take on dishes. Attached is the picture of the vegetarian burger and delicious patas bravas I had."
Cute,Date of visit: November 2019,"Nice vegetarian / vegan cafe. Great tasting food, good, friendly service. Nice wine. Easy to find. Healthy food at affordable prices."
Average,Date of visit: November 2019,"Came for dinner because of the good reviews however was disappointed with food and service. I hadn’t even finished eating my starter when the waitress came to clear away my partners plate and tell us mains were ready, while staring blankly at us for a response. This made me feel rushed and uncomfortable. Main course came and halloumi burger was nice but sweet pot fries were cold. Overpriced for average food and service."
,,
This place gets busy!,Date of visit: November 2019,"I should start by saying that this is a vegetarian restaurant. I am not vegetarian. You can't book unless you have a party over 12 people. It opens at 11am and is extremely busy from the start. There is a bar where you can have a mocktail or two while you wait for a table. There is a buzz around the place from the moment you enter, we got the last two persons table and then the queue started. The food is excellent. The starters are very well portioned and the mains also (I didn't have room for a dessert) which looked and sounded interesting. The staff although very busy are very attentive, service can be a bit slow because it's so busy. We were there for a pre matinee theatre lunch and came out feeling full and very satisfied but not bloated.We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will try and get back very soon. Prices were very reasonable for a place in Soho in the heart of London."
Everything I’d hoped for...and more,Date of visit: November 2019,I have been wanting to try Mildreds for so long. Today we were in our way to the they’re and called in for lunch and we were not disappointed. Service was great. The choice of food on offer was also amazing. I had the porcini arancini followed by the chik’n kebabs. My husband had the Halloumi and the chik’n burger and chips. We both loved it and it was so tasty. Loved everything about it. An extra splash of chilli sauce have it a bit of a kick. Then to top it off a salt caramel martini (any my husband has the white chocolate martini ❤️❤️❤️). We will definitely be going again. Soon.
Friendly vegetarian,>  >,"Great place for well thought out vegetarian and vegan food. Friendly service. Tasty polish burger, and soul bowl and mushroom arancini."
Amazing food and great atmosphere,>,"It’s over ten years since our first visit to Mildred’s and we were looking forward to it.We waited an hour for a table with the efficient tab system and had some lovely food choices.Due to the layout of the place, we ended up chatting with our neighbours discussing pudding options - the atmosphere is so relaxed and friendly.Absolutely stuffed when we left; loved it.Incidentally; interesting tiles in the toilets!"
"Amazing staff, fantastic food",Date of visit: November 2019,"I cannot sing the praises of this restaurant highly enough! Each staff member who served us was welcoming and friendly. We popped in on a Friday lunchtime and had to wait in a queue for about 15 - 20 minutes, but the food was SO worth the wait!! The gyoza dumplings, at £6, are a really tasty starter but they're so good i wish they'd been a main instead. There are so many tasty and healthy dishes it was very difficult to choose, as I wanted to eat a bit of everything! The sausages (made from parsnips as well as other things - beans I think) with mustard mash were very tasty, and I especially enjoyed the zingy redcurrant gravy they came with. Tenderstem broccoli was available to have on the side to add to the meal. They had very ncie freshly-made organic apple and orange juice, which my wife enjoyed, but I opted for a nice pale ale, which was also tasty. We'd been placed in a window seat upstairs so it felt nice and intimate, whereas the atmosphere downstairs seemed more busy and bustling. I hope I get to return here in the future."
Delicious food and cocktails,Date of visit: November 2019,Been told to try this place for a while even if not vegan so decided to go with a group of friends (mixed group of vegan/veggie etc). It worked for everyone and the drinks were lovely as well. I especially recommend the teriyaki burger and the artichoke.
Delicious burgers,>,Delicious veggie burgers and divine moctails. Both halloumi and teriyaki chick’n burgers were so good. Good price for this quality.
Mildreds does it again and again and....,>  >  >,"Never miss Mildreds when in London. This crowed, friendly restaurant is worth the wait in line. Have a great drink in the bar while waiting. The food is healty vegetarian/vegan with great tastes. I’ll be back!"
Perfect meal,>  >  >  >,"There were so many rave reviews of the food, we wanted to try everything so we ordered 6 appetizers. Each was better than the next. The aubergines with pomegranate were sweet and satisfying. The celeriac skordalia was delicious and a flawless com I nation of flavors. The gyoza dumplings were heavier and more filling than expected—my husband loved them. The spiced halloumi was delicious and the hazelnut dukkah was our favorite. Yes there was a wait but the gin and tonic at the bar helped the time fly by while waiting. We plan to return again during our short time in London. Outstanding."
Excellent,>  >,"Due to its popularity, Mildreds is extremely busy so a 15+ minute wait was inevitable. Drinks at the small bar and when at the table, service was good and efficient. Dumplings to start with then teriyaki chicken burger with fries. Excellent all round and food very tasty, delivered very quickly. The 'optional' service charge is not hidden, clearly displayed on your bill before payment. Really enjoyed it and highly recommended."
,,
Very special place,Date of visit: October 2019,I had my doubts of eating at a fully vegan restaurant. Now one of my favourites. This little gem serves outstanding food of exceptional quality. Fabulous staff. Quirky surroundings. Very relaxed atmosphere. A must go-to.
"""Optional"" service charge",Date of visit: November 2019,"12.5% ""optional"" service charge automatically added to the bill and charged on your card without your consent. Really soured what was a lovely meal. I probably would have tipped more had it been my choice but I definitely will not be going back now."
"Exciting food, delicious cocktails",Date of visit: November 2019,"We are new to plant based eating and thought we'd do a google for good vegan food in Soho - Mildreds came up and we took a mosey there, although we weren't able to book as it's walk ins only. The 40 minute wait turned into an hour, but we entertained ourselves with a cocktail or two (I can't remember the names but they were delicious). We were encouraged by just how busy it was as well, so our tummies were rumbling by the time we got our table. I had the arancini to start, followed by the halloumi burger and then the biscoff cheesecake and everything was utterly gorgeous. Some of the best food I've had in London full stop. Mr Pinkystan's chk'n burger was cold and there was a mixup with his pudding, and he was a bit grumpy that our waiter said something like 'I'm not pouring your wine as I've poured enough wine tonight', and the wine wasn't cold (it was white so should be really), but in spite of all that he STILL said he wouldn't hesitate to come back because the experience overall was great. And the food was tasty even if it wasn't piping hot : )"
"Tasty food, fun atmosphere",Date of visit: October 2019,"Veggie place with amazing atmosphere, frenetic pace to serving but really interesting and deliciously tasty food. No booking so pick you time or prepare to queue!"
Don't miss it,Date of visit: November 2019,"I was here for lunch with my family, we all are vegans, and this restaurant was the perfect spot. The food was amazing, flavored, nice presentation. The place is really clean. The staff was nice and friendly. I highly recommend it"
The Best,>,"What a busy restaurant, at 5.40 there were tables by 6.05 they were queues out the door. Food is was excellent we had the sri lankan sweet potato and cashew nut curry, delicious and the service was excellent given how busy they were. Definitely recommend it and I’ll be back."
Loved the parsnip and apple,Date of visit: October 2019,Loved the parsnip and apple sausages and caramel cheesecake. Sublime. Other menu items also very good. Wouldrerererecommend
Unbelievably good,Date of visit: October 2019,"Second time we have eaten at a Mildred's. From the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out you know you are in safe hands. The man with the i pad trying to squeeze everyone in makes you feel wanted! It was so busy but we only had to wait quarter of an hour and drink a fantastic negroni while waiting for our table. Service, fantastic, laid back but so efficient and friendly. I don't know how they do it in this tape measure of a room! And the food! Sublime! God I love the food, so delicious, but fresh and healthy at the same time. The whipped tahini, the chick n the beautiful laskan curry and the fries, even the fries are delicious. Mildred, you can do no wrong!"
"Finesse, flavour and food beyond belief!",Date of visit: October 2019,"Vegetarian and vegan food that carefully considers every ingredient on the plate. Locally sourced, fresh and original flavour combinations that give Mildred’s it’s hallmark food. There is nothing rushed here and the cosy venue creates fine dining without the snobbery or over confident service/waiting staff.A joy that we both continue to talk about. If only we could eat at Mildred’s everyday! Amazing!!"
Worth the wait.,Date of visit: October 2019,"So busy here but justifiably. A fantastic choice at not ridiculous prices. Just watch out though, we had to wait a while so spent more on G&T than we should! Staff lovely too."

Heavenly experience,Date of visit: October 2019,"It was a busy and vibrant Saturday night, in the middle of Soho, London. I was with my girlfriends and we were hungry. Very hungry. The time was not much, but the burning desire to get in there was a lot.We were outside, shivering in absolute hunger. The owner (I’m assuming) managed to get the 6 of us in there shortly after. Once we got in, I was completely mind blown: the place was insanely beautiful and the atmosphere was almost lysergic. We got escorted to our table, that viewed over the street. I felt like I was under a spell. After ordering amazing beers, cocktails and water, the magic happened: we got our burgers, I ordered the polish one. It was so good I almost cried. It reminded me of the flavors of my youth in Russia during the 30s. The staff is adorable and contributed to this surreal and extraordinary experience. Highly recommended, I’ll definitely be back when in London. Thank you guys. x"
3.5 A good light alternative for food delivery,Date of visit: October 2019,"When ordering food from the sofa (which I very rarely do) the largest choice is for comfort food, at least on my post code. I found Mildreds to be a fair healthy option and they have food hygiene 4. Ordered with Deliveroo, food arrived pretty quickly. I did not like the dumpling but mostly because grilled and I prefer them steamed, definetly will no re-order them.The curry was light, fresh, delicate but spicy, pleasant overall.No sad staff and chaos as per the other revews as I ate confortably at home.I would not queue for this though, so not sure why people are waiting for over an hour."
Superb experience,>,"Friendly environment, great service, relaxed atmosphere. Food extremely delicious, great value! Definitely will come back as soon as we have a chance to visit London again!"
Overpriced & disappointing,Date of visit: September 2019,Overpriced and the food is nothing to get excited about. Very disappointed as had heard good things about the place.
Delicious and exciting,Date of visit: October 2019,"Brilliant and very friendly staff. Delicious food, and interesting selection of alcohols.It's the best vegan restaurant I've been so far."
Cramped restaurant,Date of visit: September 2019,"The food was great with so many vegan options that I love to see! However, the restaurant was overcrowded and the tables far too close to one another. I know it's popular and the restaurant is small but that doesn't mean I want to be sat on top of the people next to us."
Tastes like chicken!,Date of visit: October 2019,"There is so much in the news these days about how we should be eating less meat, having meat free days and how we should all be vegetarian!Well Mildred's ticks all these boxes without climbing atop a soap box. The menu is short but varied with playful meat free options and a great fruit juice menu too.I had the Tofu Jerk Chicken even though I vowed never to eat Tofu again after a trip to China. This was excellent.Not my first visit to Mildred's and I still wish the Mushroom and Ale pie was still on the menu.Excellent quality, service and good value too. They also have an excellent salad bar for take outs"
Definitely below average,Date of visit: October 2019,"I had dinner at Mildreds and was very negatively impressed by the food.It was heavy and the taste too strong.. probably not very good quality ingredients covered with flavors.. However, service was kind."
This has gone downhill,Date of visit: September 2019,"I’ve been going to Mildred’s for years and have absolutely lobed it but my visit on Friday the 20th was very disappointing. The service was awful, I ordered an espresso martini before my pudding and it arrived 15 minutes afterwards and the staff only said the ‘bar was busy’ with no apology. The wait staff also took a long time to take our order and seemed to be going through the motions as if it was too much effort for them. The menu is not as creative as it once was. Before it show cased the best of vegetarian food and now there are one or two ‘chick’n’ options. I do not want to eat fake chicken in a vegetarian restaurant. I used to love going to Mildred’s but as ordinary restaurants have got better at veggie food they have to up their game. The skinny fries replacing the beautiful chunky chips and basil mayo was a disaster. Could have been a halloumi burger from any establishment. Very disappointing."
Happy vegans,>,Awesome!!! Some of the best vegan food I’ve ever eaten. We tried the “chicken” and the curry! Both were amazing
,,
Perfect in every way,Date of visit: September 2019,"We walked in at around 3pm on a Saturday for a late lunch and were lucky enough to get a table straight away. It seems like we turned up just at the right time as an hour later there was a queue out the door to get a table! The food was lovely - how refreshing to have items on the menu labelled as “non-vegan” for a change! I had the Caribbean jerk tofu which was great and allowed me to try plantain for the first time. We had sides of chips, pomegranate pesto aubergine and lemon miso broccoli to share, all of which were great. The caramel and blackberry cheesecake for dessert is making my mouth water just thinking about it as I type, it was by far the best vegan dessert I’ve ever had. The best thing about the ambience of the restaurant was the amazing music they were playing - I kept using Shazam to make sure I could add all the brilliant old songs to my collection. It was great to see the bartender singing and dancing along too! I caught a glimpse of the kitchen on my way to the toilet and it looked immaculate - I could see people cleaning as they went. We had to ask a couple of times for the bill but that was understandable since they’d got so busy. Will definitely he returning to try out some of the other dishes on this awesome menu!"
Disappointing,Date of visit: September 2019,"I found it disappointing that such a renowned vegetarian restaurant with good quality ingredients has such a limited option for people that can’t eat chilli or paprika. Even more unfortunate the answer I was given and I quote “we need to give flavour to the dishes”. The only option I had was to choose a plate of ricotta tortelloni. Regarding the service, the waiter and the kitchen seemed more concerned in avoiding getting in trouble compared to providing a proper option for me to eat. In many other restaurants I am normally provided with chilli free versions of the dishes - this was discussed but each suggestion I provided was dismissed."
Great vegetarian spot,Date of visit: September 2019,"I was tipped off to this restaurant by a walking tour guide (from the HP tour) when I asked for a lunch recommendation for vegetarians and couldn’t have been happier. They have choices from stir fry to veggie burgers etc. I had the gochujang bowl and it was great. A little spicy but not over the top, and packed with well cooked veggies and tofu. I also went for dessert and enjoyed the chocolate tart. Also enjoyed the guava mocktail. Will also mention it’s in a great spot and I’m sure at peak times it’s packed but I managed to squeeze in right away. Would go back for sure."
Incredible,Date of visit: September 2019,"Well worth the queue, was told it would be a 40 minute wait but ended up only being 25 minutes. Food was amazing, so flavoursome and good portion sizes. I’ve never tasted vegan food as good as this."
Don't go there to eat!,Date of visit: September 2019,"The food is bland, boring and hugely overpriced.Non interested service.The place is as loud as a football stadium. Impossible to have a conversation.Left hungry and disappointed."
Extensive veggie and vegetarian menu in lively atmosphere,Date of visit: September 2019,"We showed up for dinner at about 5:30 pm, but were told that there was a 20 minute wait for a table. As we could no wait, we went to Veggie Pret across the street. But we showed up at Mildreds Soho for lunch the next day. It was worth returning. For me, there were so many interesting and different items on the menu, and the food was tasty."
"Great spot for those, who love good food",Date of visit: September 2019,"Lovely restaurant with amazing vegetarian menu suitable for anyone. Fresh, well thought-through dishes, great selection for any meal of the day. The staff is friendly and helpful. Will come back if in Londo."
Wednesday night,Date of visit: August 2019,"Went on a Wednesday night around 8pm and was told there was an 50-60 minute wait. We ordered drinks but had to stand outside as the restaurant was crowded.Annoyingly the restaurant offered a group of 4 a table before the 2 of us even though we had arrived first. I appreciate they need to fill the restaurant but waiting outside in the cold they could have at least apologised to us.We shared the crostini/bruschetta and the rolls to start. The rolls were great, a little kick and strong taste of coriander. The crostini was excellent with well cooked artichokes and a delicious garlic flavour aioli.We then shared the polish burger and the Sri Lankan curry. The burger was disappointing as at £9 it was small, lacked flavour beyond the small party and didnt come with a side.The curry was really good and of a decent size. It was very moreish. We were too full for dessert."
Some of the best veg food we've eaten,Date of visit: August 2019,"There's a great bubbling atmosphere, and you can tell this place has a great reputation because there was a 20 minute queue for a table. When we finally sat down, what was on offer was very impressive - we ordered ""jerk tofu"" and ""Lebanese chick'n"" curries and the ""teriyaki chick'n"" burger. Basically delicious! (It's called ""chick'n"" because it's fake chicken, get it?). The waiting staff were polite and attentive and we didn't mind waiting because of that. I would say it's pricey, but this is central London we're talking about, and the fresh ingredients are obviously of a high quality."
Tasty well priced vegan/vegetarian food,>  >,"Seated at a perfect table in the sun. Service was very quick. I ordered the aubergine pomegranate side with the cauliflower from the starter menu. The portion sizes were very good but I found the food quite oily. My friend ordered the Chick'n from the main, which was a pretty big dish, although maybe the plate was too small for the heaped amount of food. The music inside was a bit strange; quite evening club-like inside. Overall, 4 out of 5."

Very nice!!!,Date of visit: August 2019,I am not a vegetarian however my friend is. I chose this restaurant for her as we always go to meat restaurants. I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the food. I had the halloumi burger which was delicious and the sweet potato fries were incredible. Nice atmosphere and really attentive staff. I would definitely visit again and highly recommend a visit.
Incredible,Date of visit: August 2019,I was visiting london and had a very good meal here. The stir fry is amazing and the service was great.
What is not to love about this place? Not just for vegetarians at all!,Date of visit: August 2019,Been meaning to go for years as havent been since they moved from Greek Street in Soho. Wow have I missed out. I am a pescatarian now and my wife eats meat...and then we were close by and thought we'd give it a go...Had to wait about 20 minutes but they warned us and they do great cocktails there...the food is just so delicious..service is top rate(didn't catch his name but a lad from Cork)...you are close to other customers so not for a romantic date but it's not too cramped....nice selection of wines too..We would advise anyone to try this out at least once...we will certainly be back..So nice to see written on the bill that 100% of the service charge goes to the staff!
"Outstanding food, drinks and service",Date of visit: August 2019,"I absolutely love this place, an absolute must for us when in London. It is hip but in no way pretentious. The food is absolutely delicious, it truly shows that vegan food can be interesting, nutritious and oh so yummy! Don’t get put off by the sometimes rather long waiting time to get a table (45min-1 hour is what we normally had to wait) instead enjoy some of the fantastic cocktails! The service was always super friendly despite it being busy and the food is just wonderful!!I’d highly recommend Mildreds to anyone as I cannot believe anyone would not be blown away by their food (...and their cocktails:)!"
Fabulous Lunch,>,Enjoyed a fabulous lunch at Mildred’s Vegetarian and Vegan restaurant. Although very busy we were seated quite quickly and did not have to wait long for the food. Every mouthful was delicious. Highly recommended.
"Delicious food, long queue",Date of visit: August 2019,"Long wait before there was a table as there are no bookings. Not many places to wait either. Good food, absolutely delicious. Interesting mix. Would go again."
Best space in LONDON for Vegetarians,Date of visit: July 2019,"My regular now so much option for vegetarians and with gluten, vegan options its the ideal space and the food is of very high energy the staff are so friendly and you can feel the food freshness and cooked with great love."
"Favourite vegetarian, vegan, gluten free space in london",Date of visit: July 2019,"My favourite restaurant in LONDON, the energy of this space is surreal, its always busy as you wait for a table because you cannot reserve however the turnaround is quick and the wait is worth it... The best clean, high energy vibrational food I have had and being vegetarian wheat and gluten free makes it easier and for those vegan also best space."
A real gem in Soho,Date of visit: August 2019,"I visited Mildred’s for the first time today. One of my friends had given me their recipe book and I wanted to try out the real thing! I went early (around 11.30 am) as I had read it was very popular and I can see why. I was made to feel really welcome and I loved the friendly atmosphere. The staff were attentive and helpful and made recommendations. I had the dumplings and stir fry and a pink fizz. It was all exceptional and so good I didn’t want it to end! It was also very reasonably priced for central London. Sadly, I didn’t have room for a dessert but that gives me another good reason to return! I really enjoyed myself and can wholeheartedly recommend Mildred’s. I can’t wait for my next visit."
Had no idea!,Date of visit: August 2019,"Ok so I’m new to this whole vegan thing, and expecting now a lifetime of wishing I had a steak. My whole perception of vegan was changed by Mildred’s amazing menu options. The food was amazing, the customer service lovely and I left feeling full, content and happy that today a cow lived. Thanks Mildred’s for showing ( rather cooking) me to the light."
,,
Good food and good staff.,Date of visit: May 2019,"I really liked this restaurant both in terms of the food they served and the team that worked there. The menu isn't extensive but you can tell a lot of time and work has gone into the items on it. Each part of every meal has been thought through and it shows. I went with a group of mixed vegetarians and meat eaters and everyone was deeply impressed with their meals, no complaints about the lack of meat from anyone. Drinks selection could be better but the drinks we had were all nice. Staff are attentive and informed about the menu, they engage well with customers and seemed genuinely friendly. On the downside this restaurant can get very busy and there can sometimes be a bit of a wait."
Great Vegetarian Food,Date of visit: July 2019,"Need to find a veggie restaurant for global veggie visitors. Went on a recommendation from son we were not disappointed. German visitors said it was best meal they had England in three weeks. Broad menu. We ordered curries, burgers, quiche, salads all really delicious. Good service, air con, bright airy, lively place. Reasonably priced for central London."
Disappointed,Date of visit: August 2019,"It used to be my favourite restaurant.However, today the food was cold, a waitress forgot our drink and asked the bill for a few times and had to waited to get a bill for ages.The service charge has been added to the bill already otherwise I would not leave tip really."
best lunch ever,Date of visit: September 2018,"I was in London for a trip with a friend, and we could not wait to eat there: our expectations were largely satisfied!A beautiful location, kind staff and delicious meals and I still remember the taste of the ravioli and of the chocolate cake we had! Amazing!"
Popular Vegan / Vegetarian restaurant in Central London,Date of visit: July 2019,"A party of 10 which despite not taking reservations, managed to seat us altogether upstairs in a smaller room.We shared a selection of starters and then had a main course each.Interesting range of dishes, quite eclectic and colourful. Everyone enjoyed their food and the portion size was good.We arrived early (1730) and left at 1900 as we were going to the theatre. As we left there was a long queue of people waiting for tables, so clearly very popular."
Some of the best vegan food I've ever had.,Date of visit: July 2019,"I've been here about 4 times now and it's always excellent. Be prepared for a busy place. It's usually packed, especially at lunchtime. I'd recommend the jerked tofu amdake space for the desserts as all of the are awesome. Just a spectacular place for lunch."
No surprise really !!,Date of visit: July 2019,"My wife and myself have been visiting Mildred’s for a long time now .Originally this was a very appreciated restaurant but over the last few years it has become increasingly more CHAIN !!! The menu has been dramatically reduced , no more special boards , even though the menu was always kept within a sensible size . Portions have become smaller and even the personal touch by mainly new staff has disappeared .The restaurant quite sensibly uses a queue by number system .When we turned up a few weeks ago there was a bit of a queue which I always take as a good sign . The hostess told us it would be half an hour to be seated so we happily ordered a drink . When the opportunity arose I asked the hostess if the restaurant was still owned by the girl who originally started the restaurant . She said it had been bought out by some kind of financial group and I immediately picked up that my interest was not appreciated .Our number was for sake of the point 39 . I soon watched two girls walk in towards the girl in charge and she asked them loud enough for us to hear , ‘ are you number 40 , follow me ‘ .That was enough , we reluctantly paid the woman ( who clearly had no concern ) for our drinks . We will never return . SAD ."
Quirky Vegetarian Restaurant with Delicious Vegan Options,Date of visit: December 2018,"We have visited Mildred's on numerous occasions and at two different locations, and have not so far been disappointed.Unfortunately, it isn't possible to book a table in advance so if you don't arrive early enough, you may have to wait a while for space to become available but boy is it worth the wait?!The food is well-cooked, well-thought out and well-presented."
Great Food,Date of visit: July 2019,"The place had a very nice atmosphere, and the staff were good. The food was fantastic, got the Stir Fry with rice, which was a decent sized portion, and tasted great."
Very delicious vegan food,>  >,"I went here with my mother who is skeptical of a vegan/vegetarian restaurant but she ended up enjoying it! We arrived here around 6:30pm and then there was a 30 minute wait - which wasn’t too bad as people after us were waiting for an 1 hour 20 plus! However, we got a drink at the bar and then got escorted to the table. I thought the food was great and would highly recommend. For starters we got a cauliflower dish to share which was very unique - not something I’ve tried before - but was tasty nonetheless. For mains I got the Stir fry with black rice which was amazing! I’d highly recommend this dish! My dining partner got the curry which she said was very good as well. I’d recommend this restaurant to meat-eaters, vegetarians and vegans."

Food coma caused by vegan food! 🤔🥰🙏 Yep! It's possible!,>  >  >  >,My partner took me to Mildred in Soho to celebrate my 2 months of being vegetarian! I cheated 4 times but apart from those 4 times I was strictly eating vegetarian diet. I was so impressed with the food and the fact that vegan can tastes so good! I was also very surprised when my boyfriend(very keen meat lover) said he loves the food! We had some hummus with pita bread for starters and then I ordered the Lebanese chick'in and he had the halloumi burger as main coarse! Just go and try! The plant based meat was better than actual chicken meat nowadays that tastes like antibiotics! And for dessert we had the vegan rum and coconut truffles! Yummy!The only thing that was not as great was the service but it was very busy and they sat us at the bar for about 45min to wait for a table! Once we were seated it took a while to order and there was this table next to us that go seated after us but got food before us hahaha but I forgive the servers! The were slightly avoided eye contact with me but it's all good! The food was amazing! This restaurant is a cute little gem in my favourite Soho
Delicious!,>  >,Fabulous choice of vegetarian dishes - I had the teriyaki chick’n with some sweet potato fries and it was yummy! The staff were attentive and the service was quick. Will definitely be back!
Laid back yummy vegan food,>  >  >  >,"We arrived quite late and were advised there was an hour wait for a table. We didn’t mind waiting, had a drink outside and were eventually seated upstairs. The menu is good and I really couldn’t decide what to try. I had a Sri Lanka chickn which was lovely. The cheesecake was unbelievable. I have had a lot of vegan cheesecake and always been disappointed but not this one!"
Yummy,Date of visit: July 2019,Great food in a nice friendly environment. Crowded but in a trendy way. Delicious food with fresh ingredients. Subtly flavoured; not overdosed with salt or acidic tastes. The lemon curd dessert was wonderful. Good wine selection. Smack dab in a fun part of London. Will go again and again.
Amazing food arrived late BUT they turned it round!,Date of visit: July 2019,"The four of us got there before 12pm and they weren’t ready for us. So went back at 12pm for lunch before watching an afternoon show. Ordered starters which were yummy and waited and waited for mains. We ordered 3 mains as we wanted to try the desserts too. Everyone else’s food came and finally we asked how much longer and the waiter said there was s problem with the computer. He apologised, as did the manager, we waited a bit longer and I’d got grumpy people on my table and then the mains came. The food was superb. We ordered the top 3 desserts on the list as recommended by the waiter. They were perfect, loved the lemon polenta! Wish we had more time to savour every mouthful! The manager cancelled the service charge and the starters were on the house. They turned it round and won us over. Go here and enjoy beautiful food, you won’t regret it!"
Lunch,Date of visit: July 2019,Absolutely delicious food great service and great atmosphere. Would highly recommend. Very popular place to eat so be aware you may need to book or be patient. Will be going back again.
Incredibly delicious,Date of visit: June 2019,"Let me add yet another fantastic review of Mildred's. We all enjoyed our food (and creative non-alcoholic drinks) immensely! The Soul Bowl is amazing - so flavorful yet so seemingly simple. We visited in June 2019. We're a family spanning many years, with some vegans and some non-, and everyone loved it! Very good service too. We bought the cookbook! Highly recommended!"
Awesome - as always,Date of visit: July 2019,"We always visit when in London, and this was yet another triumph. Nice and relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, but the star of the show is the quality of the food; flavourful, healthy (relatively, at least!) and beautifully presented. I was interested to see how it was now Mildred's has branched out to other locations - conclusion is the same high quality as ever! Go!(Lunchtime visit, July 2019)."
Great Vegan food in Soho,>  >,"This unassuming baby blue fronted vegan cafe in Soho has a tiny front but inside is a rabbits warren of staircases and sharing dining rooms. The service is fast and polite and the kitchen churns our specials and menu items in under ten minutes. We had the Polish Burger (amazing beetroot and dill flavour), Teriyaki Burger (you won’t believe it’s not chicken) and the Arancini rice, lentil and chili balls washed down with Carrot and Ginger juice and Black Isle Lager. Super impressed with this quality little eatery. Go."
"Great food, busy location",Date of visit: July 2019,"Great buzzy little restaurant in heart of Soho.This is vegetarian food at its best! Fresh flavours, with a Moroccan vibe. The moc Lebanese ‘chicken’ was great, seasoned well, good combination of spiced sauces & a baba ganoush type side. All mopped up with a fresh pita bread-delicious. Service was swift and friendly. Advise to get here early as restaurant has a no booking policy for smaller tables."
,,
best vegetarian restaurant,Date of visit: June 2019,"when ever I am in London I always go to Mildredsheads up at dinner time their is a line out the door.so book ahead or go earlythe food is amazing very creative, and 1st class Vegetarian."
Amazing Vegetarian Meal in Soho,Date of visit: June 2019,"End of June in London, the place was packed. Even so we were seated within 30 minutes. The food was amazing, it's difficult to explain to non Mediterranean's how bad Hummus is in Europe, but Mildreds was great, chunky and fresh very good. The mains were a curry and a non meat burger both exquisite. Even the niece that eats only fries had nothing but praise for the spicy potatoes. As a side note, we ate on the 2nd floor the pictures on the walls were vintage X rated material. I do understand the chic appeal but for some people might not feel the same."
yummy,Date of visit: June 2019,"Arrived around 19:30, were told there was a 40-45 minute wait but we were welcome to drink cocktails in their bar / street patio area while we waited, which was delightful for people watching. Estimation time was on the dot. We went in to get a second round of drinks and they let us know our table was ready. We ordered a cauliflower starter, as well as the sri lankan curry and the soul bowl as mains, all of which were delicious. We were incredibly impressed by the careful and considerate allergen notes on the menu. It's rare to find somewhere that helpfully anticipates that despite being a vegan, you still may be allergic to things. We topped everything off with a reasonably priced bottle of rose. After finishing our dinner, we were left to just sit and chill without feeling pressured to leave. They were very understanding when we tried to pay with a note that was out of circulation by accident. Overall, a delightful dining experience that we would highly recommend (if you're willing to fork out a few extra pounds)."
Great food and atmosphere,Date of visit: June 2019,"Really loved the food here, servers are very attentive and constantly bringing water to the table. I had the chick’n burger which was really delicious as were the sweet potato fries. Quite expensive, but worth it. Atmosphere is great although quite noisy!"
Outstanding!,Date of visit: June 2019,"My friend and I ate here on Sunday eve - we hadn't booked but managed to get a table easily despite it being busy. I'd done a search for veggie restaurants - my friend is veggie and although I like veggie food, I am very much an omnivore! The food was fantastic! I had a ""chicken"" burger and my friend had the mushroom pie - both delicious. I would recommend this place and certainly seek it out again next time I'm in London. My only criticism is the lack of beer choices. But the food is so good, it wouldn't stop me coming here :-)"
So yummy!,>  >,"Our lunch at Mildreds was totally fabulous! Everything we ordered was so tasty and fresh. We had dumplings, Sri Lankan curry and jerk tofu, all to die for! The venue was very loud, which was the only negative thing I could think of, but the spectacular food was totally worth that noise."
Best Vegan Restaurant in the UK,Date of visit: June 2019,Wow; What an incredible experience. We ate here for our Silver Wedding Anniversary with three of our daughters and we were blown away. Food was sensational; a very varied menu ; everybody had different dishes James the Manager showed us to our table and set the tone in just the right way. Dominica was a very attentive friendly waitress. Anna the overall General Manager came to say hi. Portions were considerable; drinks were flowing; Its just one of those nights that will stay with us ever. Congrats Mildreds on an exceptionally well run restaurant.
Small Portions,Date of visit: June 2019,"I like to eat. I have a good appetite. I am a man, I weigh 99 kg, I work out a lot. I went here for lunch, had a starter, main course and dessert and left hungry. The quality is good and the service is good. I can't fault it except to say that if you are a reasonably sized health male you should probably eat before you go here. I ate afterwards."
Amazing Staff & Food,Date of visit: June 2019,"Myself and a friend decided to come here because she had dietary restrictions and this place was the best place that we could ensure that she wouldn’t have any trouble with that.The food is amazing, we had the chick’n burger which was gorgeous and super yummy, as well as sharing sweet potato fires - who can go wrong with sweet potato fries though?Then we had desert - this menu is separate from the main menu and it isn’t on display outside, at least not that I could see, but there is one and it is so good!The staff were delightful, cheerful and calm even though it was really busy, and the food arrived so quickly that I had honestly expected to wait a little bit longer to get fed.The staff are more than happy to have banter with you, they will help you if you have any dietary issues - although it has to be stated that they can’t guarantee that everything will be completely free from whatever issue you may have. It’s definitely one to check out - although we believe that the menu’s vary from each Mildred’s, so you might not find the same menu if you went to one in Camden for example - either that or the website that we looked at hasn’t been updated."
"Great food, cool atmosphere",Date of visit: June 2019,"Looked for a vegetarian restaurant in London, and was lucky to find Mildred’s. Great food, cool atmosphere, and very convenient located. Also to those who wa nuts to try veg for the first time, this is the place to go."
,,
Terrific food,Date of visit: June 2019,Mildreds is a must for Vegetarians. no reservations so plan on a wait on site. Well worth it. Food is excellent and value is very good.Its noisy and crowded but fun
Excellent food,>,"100% vegetarian restaurant, excellent food portions, taste and the service was impeccable! All the staff are extremely helpful, continually providing water to your table. The server is pretty snappy too. Note that many of the dishes are quite spicy! But still very enjoyable.Quite an expensive eat too, however its just a reflection of the quality. Downside was that it was extremely noisy inside and hard to hear the people @ your table! Expected in such a busy restaurant! ALSO NO BOOKINGS ALLOWED so be prepared to wait. (We waited about 30 mins) Well worth it!"
Restaurant has got lazy,Date of visit: June 2019,"I agree with other recent reviews I have read that this restaurant is now relying solely on reputation rather than putting effort into creative and well-cooked meals and good customer service. I have been here many times over the years, being vegetarian and living in London. The menu constantly changes which is a benefit of the restaurant. However it does mean it is sometimes hit-and-miss as to whether you'll get a nice meal. On my most recent trip, I had the Jerk 'Chicken' Tofu, which was very badly cooked - really dry and tasteless. My boyfriend had a selection of starters which were all good. When I mentioned to the staff that the tofu was dry, the only response was - 'It's tofu, tofu is dry'. Absolute rubbish - chicken is also dry unless you cook it right. The staff weren't trained to deal with feedback and instead we were just brought the bill with the service charge added. The staff are young and inexperienced and the restaurant just seems to not be making much of an effort anymore, presumably relying on tourist and 'one-off' visitors rather than repeat custom like myself."
Very innovative,Date of visit: June 2019,The place was a small and cozy restaurant with a great ambience. It is a vegan and vegetarian friendly place. We ordered a Mexican burger which had amazing mix of flavours and mushroom pie was good too. The food overall was great. We would like to visit again to try more food!!
Fabulous,Date of visit: June 2019,"We popped in on a busy Friday lunch time, we only waited 10 minutes for a table. Angelica our server, was friendly and offered great service. The food was fabulous, I’m the non veggie in the group. We opted for burgers and sweet potato fries and a carafe of rose wine. The food was tasty and reasonably priceWell worth a visit"
So good!,>,"Luckily managed to find a seat there for lunch on a Saturday. It was my first time there and I really enjoyed the food. The portions are big and I felt the price was worth it. Loved the corn bread, and the Sri Lankan curry was mouthwatering! Really recommend it, can’t wait to return and try other dishes."
Vegetarian / Vegan delight but be prepared to waif,Date of visit: June 2019,"I've eaten there three times now. Each time, one lunch and two evening meals, it's been packed. The food is excellent - although the first visit was probably the best, mybe a novelty factor at play. I have enjoyed - amongst other dishes - the mushroom and ale pie, the hoummous and on one occasion a bottle of the house white. It's not cheap but it's one f the best vegetarian eateries in London town. You can't book and if you arrive to find a queue, you could be lucky and find a seat at the bar for a pre-meal beer or a glass of wine. You'll enjoy the evening."
Crowed and Delicious,Date of visit: March 2019,"This was my second time finding a Mildreds in London. I couldn't find the door! It wasn't too busy when I got there, but filled up pretty quick - and it's quite a crowded space. I was there early for dinner. By the time I left there was a whole gang up front waiting to be seated. I really like that the menu is mostly vegan, but items are clearly labeled when they are not. I have a dairy allergy so vegan dishes are a relief. I meant to just have an appy, but then there was focaccia bread and olive oil available so I had to have that, too. Then I had time for dessert, as well, and I left way too full."
Great vegeterian place in Soho,Date of visit: June 2019,The quality and freshness of products justify the prices. Very savoury food and a great cocktail menu. It can get busy and loud but the food definitely worths it. The peanut brownie dessert is a killer!!
Amazing Service & Food,Date of visit: June 2019,"Almost all vegan menu! A few different types of cuisines on offer. I went for the mushroom and Ale pie which cake with mushy peas and mint sauce serviced with chips. Flavours were spot on! Would have been perfect if used hand cut chunky chips but it was super yummy! My partner had tandoori chickn’ (He isn’t vegan) but was amazing at how much the mock chicken tastes like chicken it was sooooo good and the flavours were beautiful especially the dhal! The service was great! The host was soo welcoming and personable which I love when I dine out. Very busy!! Cosey setting, lots of seating! Overall really good experience I will 100% be returning!"

Amazing food,Date of visit: May 2019,"I loved the place, excellent food, a must try for vegans and non-vegans, if your a vegan you’ll enjoy the clean fresh food, and if you’re not a vegan you’ll think you’re eating a real buffalo chicken burger"
Top quality,Date of visit: June 2019,My curry was fantastic. Mrs. Reviewer loved her black bean burger. And that chocolate dessert featured in one the tripadvisor pictures tastes even better than it looks.
Just fab,Date of visit: April 2019,The food is absolutely lovely. Our starter was just so good. We have the artichoke with toast and aioli. So simple but the flavours were fantastic. Will definitely be visiting again.
healthy lunch,Date of visit: June 2019,"have been to this old time vegetarian restaurant several times, I like their salad bar for lunch which is very convinient for a healthy lunch."
Need to Change their Waiting System,Date of visit: June 2019,"The bar at Mildreds is too small for their policy to be operated. I am in a wheelchair and was expected to wait an hour and 15 minutes on the street (there were no seats left inside or out). Our treatment indicates that the establishment cares more about making customs at the bar than customer service or catering to those with special needs. We had seen people being given buzzers on other reviews, and so we thought that it would be ok to go round the corner to sit in Yorica while for a fraction of our wait time. Our ""host"" at first said that we could come back in 20 minutes or so but if our seat was given away in that time we would have to start in the queue all over again. We were prepared to this but he then said he couldn't give us a place in the queue at all if we didn't wait on the 'premises'.Eventually with help from the woman at the bar he gave us a place card and allowed us to go away for 20 minutes of our 1.25 waiting time, and come back with risk of our seating being given away. However the lady at the bar who was kind, misunderstood this and took back my card which I thought was odd and protested a bit in confusion.After going out to find Yorica, we decided we would not risk it and came back. After 15 minutes I asked the host if we were still in the queue because of the way he looked at me. He said exasperatedly, 'no, you're not!' After argument between us and the lady at the bar we gathered the misunderstanding but we were given a much bigger number in the queue all over again with no indication of how long we would be waiting. At this point we no longer trusted the ""host"" to give us a fair waiting time or not be spiteful. So we left, myself on the brink of tears because it was my 30th birthday dinner abroad with my girls. I was looking forward to trying Mildreds so had not booked anywhere else on a Saturday night. Luckily we found a great restaurant round the corner, Tamarind House, which had no wait time and where customer service was exceptional and still mattered.Just because Mildreds has a good online reputation does not mean it can be snooty and take customer service for granted.It does not mean it can have such thoughtless treatment towards those with special needs."
Delicious but small portions size,>  >  >,It's a cute lovely restaurant. The service was attentive and polite. The menu is almost completely vegan. I had a starter (hummus) and the soul bowl. It was delicious but in comparison with the price pretty small. For my liking it could have been a little bit bigger.
Amazing!,Date of visit: May 2019,One of the best meals I have ever had. Stunning cornbread for starters and the jerk tofu main was out of this world.
Not sure,Date of visit: May 2019,"Went with my daughter & wife who are vegetarian. I am not but do enjoy vegetarian food.We got a table but was struck by how crammed the restaurant was & poor acoustics so noisy.Folk on table for 4 next door seemed to be two couples who were not ""related"" the other table beside us had 3 cramme don a table for 2. As we left bar area was heaving & agin noisey.I had mushroom pie & fries & mushy peas. Nothing to rave about, I had similar from M & S at xmas which was better , I did note another being taken to a table with a singed crust. Wife & daughter had halloumi burgers which they said were tasty.Puddings were excellent.Staff not that engaging. Would I go again - probably not.Frank impressions, bearing in mind eating out as a vegetarian in UK seems to be a lottery in many places in terms of choice & quality from my observation. A fully vegetarian restaurant in this area seems rare.1) Too many tables & going for through put rather than an enjoyable experience for diners.2) I sense living on reputation so as a result innovation & quality suffering .3) Staff need to engage more but to be frank giving the crowded nature of the area I would not be too cheerful if I worked there."
Best vegan restaurant in London,Date of visit: January 2019,"Restaurant in soho is small so there was a but if a wait, but it was well worth it. Had the best vegan burger of my life here and best vegan and waffles at their location near King’s Cross. Really nice atmosphere, the food was so fresh and the menu has a lot of unique vegan options and desserts!"
"Outstanding vegetarian food, creative and delicious",Date of visit: May 2019,"The food is really excellent - creative without being pretentious. The ravioli is amazing and the veggie burger was one of the best I've had. Service is friendly and fast and it was just a really great meal in an unfussy environment that made me want to return. Food is not oily or heavy - so the sweet potato fries were perfect and not oily and the food was fresh and exceptionally flavorful. One of my best meals in London and highly recommended to all - vegetarians, vegans, and anyone who enjoys delicious food at a reasonable price."
,,
One of the best vegan restaurants in London,Date of visit: April 2019,"I have visited Mildred's in the Soho again this April and was delighted to see that it is still one of the best vegan restaurants in London. You can't go wrong with the menu and almost everything is delicious. I myself particularly like the bourbon buffalo chicken burger and the Tandoori chick’n dish, which are great (mock chicken of course). If you haven't been yet, I strongly recommend to give it a try."
Tasty,Date of visit: May 2019,"Love coming here, food is so good. Wish you could book a table as not keen on having to turn up and hope you get a table. Loved the chicken curry and the Thai green curry and the aubergine starter. In fact everything we’ve tried so far has been great."
So delicious!,Date of visit: May 2019,"Fantastic atmosphere and delicious food - I will definitely be back for more, even though it seems like the restaurant is understaffed so part of our order went missing (other customers next to us had the same experience). If there are no free tables, wait for one - the food is definitely worth the wait!"
Vegan curry,Date of visit: March 2019,My favourite vegan dish for years. Mildred has the best curry in London. Noone bit them yet. Basil mayo is amazing as always.
Disappointing,Date of visit: April 2019,"Was looking forward to a meal at Mildreds as a vegetarian but left feeling extremely underwhelmed. Had the halloumi burger which was lacklustre - two dry bits of pita with halloumi and a tiny slice of aubergine with some basic chips! Can easily receive food of a higher quality and more attentive service elsewhere. I feel that due to its popularity, Mildreds no longer feel the need to make an effort for their customers which is a shame. Definitely not worth the prices charged and quite a cramped atmosphere inside."
Yummy!,Date of visit: April 2019,"Very good organic vegan food! Even though the place is a bit loud, it is worth it because the food is really good! Delicious mock chicken and soul bowl! Definitely coming back!"
Worth the wait!!,Date of visit: April 2019,"Rightly a hugely popular venue, especially in the evenings. Not possible to book a table in advance so you will have to (i) arrive (ii) wait. The waiting time will depend on the size of your party, and you will NOT be seated until ALL your party have arrived. Couples - no problem it seems - accommodated refectory style. We were six and waited 90 minutes to be seated. No problem with that - we know it's worth the wait. Food great, service great, decent wine list. Just one complaint. We waited in the very cramped-cosy-sociable (depending on your point of view) bar area where the music was so loud that conversation was almost impossible. I am hearing impaired yet found it unbearably loud. There exists a perfect volume for music in this and every other sociable place but very few places get it right - low enough for conversation - loud enough to dance to. Get that right and Mildreds will be perfect."
Horrible tasteless microwaved for 30 seconds disgusting food,Date of visit: April 2019,"Why is this place so popular? It's so far up its own arse and has no reason to be. Firstly three of us were crammed onto a table for two, clearly to get in as many in and out. The menu was boring and lacked imagination, it arrived very quick after being ordered which always arouses my suspicions. Clearly all the food is sitting in rows and rows and merely heated up for a few seconds before serving. I've never known food to arrive so quickly after it had been ordered, it wasn't too dissimilar to ordering from McDonalds. It's a sad that this is one of the very few vegetarian restaurants in soho, if it had competition it might try a little harder rather than be arrogant and so crap."
Pleasant experience.,>  >,"I'm a meat eater and went here with my vegetarian friend. It is an extremely popular venue so I think coming at an odd time would be better as you can get a table. It's not a problem though, as the drinks at the bar are great. For starters we shared the hallumi and hot cherry tomatoes, both were delicious. For mains my friend had the sweet potato Mexican burger and I had the mock tandoori chicken. Everything on my dish was fantastic except the chicken which was had no flavour. The daal however was scrummy. My friends burger was delicious. We had coffee to finish which were great. Service started off great but then got a bit sloppy. I would definitely go here again. Especially with a vegetarian friend."
I'm a meat-eater and it's my fave,Date of visit: January 2019,"This is hands down my favourite restaurant in London and I'm not even a veggie!! The food is so ""meaty""!"

Recommend anyone vegan or vegetarian to visit here,>  >  >  >,"On our trip to London we visited here twice, once for an evening meal and again for lunch. Both visits were excellent and I would recommend anyone vegan or vegetarian to visit here. Although you can’t reserve a table here at their Soho restaurant there is a bar that you can get a drink at and wait for a table, it does seem to be quite busy and getting a seat to wait around the bar may be a problem for evening meals later on it the week. On our first visit, we visited on a Monday night and waiting was no more than 10 minutes. We got seated upstairs which was a nice small room with two windows and an old fireplace with a stove now placed in it. I noticed that there was a table which had two parties of three people at it, so I assume when it’s busy you could get sitting at shared tables, although there was plenty of room for privacy. For a starter I got the dumpling with some cornbread and chilli lime butter for the table both of which are vegan. For the main I got the Caribbean jerk tofu which comes with an amazing rum and guava glaze on the tofu. I was disappointed they didn’t carry an alcohol free beer on their menu and reverted to a glass of organic Spanish Syrah red, which I was told by the waiter that all their wines are vegan. To finish off I went for the Manhattan truffles which were lovely with a real rich chocolate taste, they do carry the warning that they contain alcohol. Along with this I had the mint tea, which when it came out I wasn’t expecting it to contain real fresh mint leaves, which after a few minutes brewing produced a fresh minty tea which went down well after the amazing food.Our second visit was two days later and was just for a late lunch; again I had the dumpling which once again turned out to be lovely bursting with taste from the mushrooms. We ordered a selection of deserts to try two of them being the chocolate hazelnut truffle pudding and the cheesecake. Both were amazing and I would highly recommend the cheesecake, the Biscoff base is amazing, knowing how the fresh teas were served I ordered the lemon and ginger tea, which like the mint tea came out with cuts of fresh ginger and lemon slices in it.Mildreds Soho definitely deserves 5 out of 5 in my opinion; they have a large choice of food, including vegetarian options. The only thing I would recommend is for them to stock some vegan alcohol free beer as many other vegan restaurants currently do, and I can’t be the only person looking for it."
Vegan and allergy friendly,>  >,"I went on a Friday lunch time on my own for a quick bit in London. Was great to find somewhere that I knew I had a selection on the menu to choose from. I am intolerant to gluten and dairy so i went for the Jamaican jerk tofu and it was so so good, everything that was served with it was delicious! It was packed but I got a seat at a sharing table and the vibe and staff were great. I also got a CBD mocktail!"
Fantastic,Date of visit: April 2019,"I tried several dishes and the food was fantastic. I looked at some other recent reviews who complained about service. The service staff are a bit sultry (sorry guys) but hey its a super busy place and everybody wants attention. Still rate top marks. If you go, just relax, go with the flow and you will enjoy.So impressed I bought their book on Amazon.I am not Vegan or Veggie but moving that way."
"Delicious food, but untrained staff",Date of visit: April 2019,"The place is small and it is very cramped inside - every time I needed to get out of my table I had to ask the neighbour tables to make some room. The staff is in desperate need of training. The food, however, was excellent."
Average food and sulky service,Date of visit: April 2019,"From arrival the service was very poor. The two people who served the table were sulky and disinterested, one almost rude. Out of three meals, one was very good (curry) one was OK (burger) and one was less than average (mushroom pie). I've been to Mildreds many times and this was the worst experience. I hope it was a one off."
"Grrat nosh, staff absurdly untrained",Date of visit: March 2019,"Went for a business lunch. Great fig manhattsns, delicious savory wild mushroom and ale pie, excellent buffalo cooked “chicken” sandwiches, a good curry, a decent rose. Sadly we also had a waiter from hell who ignores tables, chats with apparently off-duty waitstaff, then after repeatedly being asked for service comes over and says hey, so I’m going to get something to eat, my colleague will be by, then leaves, gets his lunch and sits at the bar with it, within spitting distance of the table, while we wait. Female wait staff helped us after giggling with the male waiter. The bartender didnt Make our drinks until prompted because she was also giggling and sharing Facebook or whatever things with the female waitress who eventually served us. The manager seemed busy joking around with other staff and had no sense of managing at all. They need a training program because this just ruined What could have been a great experience because the food was terrific. What happened to basic training for Wait staff? And I Mean basic."
Tasty food and very busy place at lunch time,>  >,I had the bangers and mash and it was so tasty! I am so happy to find a vegetarian version of bangers and mash! Definitely come early if you don’t want to wait. Quite small seating areas so may need to wait for a while
Worst service I’ve received in London,Date of visit: March 2019,It’s rare that I complain about a restaurant but this place is the most pretentious place I’ve been to in years. I think because it’s one of a few vegan friendly places in the area that the staff act as though customers should be grateful in their presence. They wouldn’t make eye contact even when ordering drinks at the bar. I would have left if it wasn’t for my friend excited for finding it for me because I’m vegan. The food was ok at best so I really don’t understand the attitude. As soon as there is some real competition in the area they will be brought back down to earth. I definitely would not recommend.
Pre show dinner,Date of visit: March 2019,"Fabulous,fabulous,fabulous food!So much amazing vegan choice! An absolute treat! For starters we had - Roman artichokes, pumpkin and sage pasta x2 and the sweet potato soup.Mains - mushroom pie with mash and peas x3 and The soul bowl.The place was PACKED!! We had cocktails at the small bar waiting for our table, which were average at best, bit disappointing.... the maitre d was great, totally on it, managing high numbers of customers efficiently, smoothly, calmly and with charm, made us feel so welcome....Unlike our waitress upstairs, who was a right misery and frankly verging on hostile... she could’ve upset the occasion, but she didn’t, as the atmosphere and food and our happy mood wouldn’t be spoiled. I would 100% recommend Mildred’s to vegans and non vegans alike! Next time we go however, I hope our waitress will be having a better day! Eating out is about the whole experience not just what’s on the plate."
Tasty food and friendly service,Date of visit: March 2019,"Being a veggie it is rare to have a choice on any menu. In Mildreds you do!Really tasty food and lots of it. Good coffee too. Desserts that are a sin in themselves.It is noisy here (lunchtime) but hey, everyone is having a good time and not eating meat, so lots of animals can be reassured and not terrified to be on the menu.Reading some of the previous reviews it is clear that not everyone who comes here to eat are actually vegetarian or vegan but maybe you can be converted through eating the tasty and healthy options and help the planet as well as saving the lives of vulnerable creatures."
,,
Amazing food!,Date of visit: March 2019,"I've wanted to visit for quite some time and ended up having 30 minutes spare before a business meeting. When I arrived, there was a short queue of people waiting to be seated but it moved fast. I told the waitress about my time constraint and also a recommendation as I didn't want anything too heavy to eat. She recommended the falafel which was absolutely exceptional! The service was fast and I managed to get to my meeting in time. I will definitely go again but this time I'll make sure I'm not time pressured!"
One of the highest quality meals I've ever had,>  >  >  >,Utterly outrageous. No idea how they do it. I entered a state of ascension eating the tandoori 'chicken'. Completely astounding food. Fantastic cocktails too. I can't remember the last time that I had a meal reach such overall perfection. I'm dragging some friends back to London next month purely so I can go again.
"Veggie or not, simply great food!",Date of visit: March 2019,"I am not vegetarian, but who cares when the food is so delicious and satisfying. I am not overstating, when I say i enjoyed one of the best meals I’ve had....and the price is ridiculous low. I would have paid double and still thought it was exceptional value!Can’t recommend enough, and the old fashion cocktails are good as well"
Wonderdul,Date of visit: March 2019,"Visited Mildred’s in Soho for the first time but it won’t be the last. Waited about 25 minutes to be seated, which gave me chance to enjoy a lovely pear flavoured mocktail at the bar. All the staff were helpful and friendly while I waited, especially the bubbly front of house lady organising the tables who was a joy to deal with.I had three courses- the service was quick and and the food was phenomenal. I recommend the gyoza to start, the Sri Lankan curry and the rhubarb polenta crumble. 10/10- will definitely be back."
Tasty food!!,Date of visit: March 2019,"I stumbled upon this place while looking for a vegetarian lunch. The food was very tasty. Their fresh pressed juices are excellent, and the servers are very friendly. I'll definitely be back. Not sure why someone would say the environment was uncomfortable. It is a nice space, bright, bustling."
Amazing,>,"Everything was amazing, from the starters to the desserts. 'Chicken'burger was outstanding.Looking forward to coming again!"
OK,Date of visit: March 2018,"Food was good, but certainly not as great as expected. I feel that much better vegetarian food can be found in other non-vegetarian restaurants. Atmosphere was great"
Excellent food but uncomfortable environment,Date of visit: February 2019,Went on a Wednesday evening when not particularly busy. Was our first time eating here and the food was faultless. However the service was poor. Staff seemed miserable and not particularly helpful and made us almost feel like our custom was unwanted. A shame as we feel reluctant to return after this experience.
Superb,Date of visit: February 2019,"An early pre-theatre trip to Mildreds turned out to be one of the best vegan dining experiences we have ever had.Even at 5 pm there were queues out of the door and it wasn’t surprising. The food was absolutely excellent. I had the mushroom pie, son and the falafel and wife had the smoked tofu and white bean sausages. Each dish was beautifully accompanied and cooked to perfection.Despite being incredibly busy the staff were very efficient and friendly.If you ever get the chance to visit I would thoroughly recommend it. We will certainly be returning."
Amazing!!!,>  >  >,The food here is absolutely brilliant. The food is super tasty and flavoursome and fresh. The Sri Lankan curry was top notch.If you are veg or vegan you will love it here.Its just a shame you cant book!
,,
Delicious veggie + gluten free food,Date of visit: February 2019,"As a gluten free vegetarian, finding decent food and a variety is hard. Mildreds was absolutely delicious and have eaten here three times, twice within one week. The allergen menu labels everything clearly and the waiters ask for details of your allergy. It also highlights cross contamination. I've had the halloumi with sweet chili sauce (heaven), nachos and guac, the sir lanka curry, tender stem broccoli, smoked aubergine (not my fave as a bit mushy), and the chocolate brownie with ice cream. All gorgeous and would go back again without hesitation.Beautiful cocktails, really yummy.Only ONLY downside is that it is quite small, so if you don't book you do have to wait, as it is so popular, but that's a sign of a good restaurant."
Lunch with my daughter,Date of visit: December 2018,I have been to Mildred’s quite a few times and have wanted to take my daughter for quite a while and finally we managed to get here! She wasn’t disappointed! We both really enjoyed our food - I had veggie sausages and mash which was yummy and she had the “chicken” burger which was really tasty! We had to wait a while to be seated so we enjoyed a fresh juice sat near the bar. It was very busy (it always is!) - but the staff were helpful and friendly. She is looking forward to visiting again ☺️
Very well run restaurant,Date of visit: February 2019,Arrived before midday and people already queuing. Staff were very efficient considering amount of people arriving at the same time for when the restaurant opened. Food was extremely tasty and choice is good. Service was brilliant. Would thoroughly recommend.
Amazing Vegetarian Restaurant,Date of visit: February 2019,"I’ve been wanting to try this place for years but haven’t been in a place where I could wait to be seated (often more than 1 hour wait). Now that I’ve finally eaten there, I know why people are willing to wait. It was excellent and the cost was very reasonable. Plan ahead to wait and you won’t be sorry."
Best Vegan Restaurant Ever!,Date of visit: January 2019,Came for my birthday and as I was doing Vegaunuary it was a good choice. It came recommended and we cane at 4.30 before it was busy. Had artichoke for starters and tandoori for mains. Excellent presentation and we thought worth the money for a London vegan restaurant. Would definitely come again
"I'm not vegetarian, but this place is just Soooo Good!",Date of visit: February 2019,"I've been eating here for over 30 years and it just gets better. My advice is always to arrive slightly early so you know you're going to get a seat. The food is outstanding and the mocktails, especially the pair and the pineapple-based ones are truly gorgeous. We have taken the kids with us a few times, and they always eat the lot."
Good place but long wait,>  >  >,"Went here as looking for vegan options. We had to queue for a table, and couldn't really leave and come back as they just shout when a table is free. That said the cocktails were excellent to while away the time. The place is buzzing. The food was tasty and plentiful and the staff helpful and friendly."
"Amazing, Amazing",Date of visit: February 2019,"We thought going early on a Saturday would avoid crowds, so we showed up at 5:00 to a packed house! We put our names in anyway and had a drink and were seated in about 30 minutes. I had the SriLanka curry dish, which was amazing. And my friend had the burger. I would go back again and again...it's worth a wait."
Top of the class!,Date of visit: February 2019,"OK, I admit it, I'm a carnivore. But in a single visit to Mildred's I'm tempted to sign any pledge you want. The service was relaxed and friendly, but you had the impression that they cared. The food was delicious. The clever combinations of herbs and spices were off the scale. And such good value. So I bought the cookery book and will most definitely be coming again, and bringing other meat eaters so that we can enjoy the revelation of fabulous vegetarian cuisine together!"
Great place.,Date of visit: February 2019,We had a lovely Saturday evening at Mildred’s visiting from out of town. Our party of four was seated very promptly and we had excellent service all evening. Delicious cocktails and great food. The restaurant even posted me back the hat I left behind - above and beyond!
,,
Luncheon with locals,>,"A very nice place, well decorated with paintings and lighting, a glass ceiling covered with greens, tasty and healthy food. It seems locals like it the most, less tourists contrary to many other places around."
An absolutely delicious meal from start to finish! Must visit when in London! So good!!,>  >  >,"Had the best meal of our entire week in London at Mildred's. Service was impeccable & laid back atmosphere put me & the kids at ease on a busy Friday night. Started off with delicious wine & beer, mushroom pie for me, buffalo chix sandwich for hubby, chix tandoori for my 11 year old, assorted apps for my daughter (gyoza, broccolini, & chix filet). All was super delicious & served very quickly.Finished with 3 amazing desserts (apple crumble, sundae, & chocolate brownie). Best part of a really great meal. So great to see a vegan/vegetarian place become packed on a Friday night with people of all ages coming in for drinks & food. A queue was forming as well so the place was so fun to be in. Waitstaff was great even though shorthanded. Will def come again when we're back in London. Would love to try brunch."
All good,Date of visit: January 2019,Definitely was not disappointed by the food or the service. First rate. This was my first time in a vegan restaurant and I’ll be back.
Great atmosphere,>  >  >  >,"My vegan friend was visiting from out of town, so we thought we would try Mildred's out. The food was stunning. The waitresses were super nice and the place was packed. The barista made us some fantastic drinks while we waited for our table as well. I do recommend this place (even as the steak lover that I am)."
Almost there.,Date of visit: January 2019,"I did enjoy my meal at Mildred’s. It was my first time there so it’s my only benchmark. The restaurant itself is a cosy spot and the choices on the menu were intriguing. The service was wonderful and the food itself was gorgeous but flavour didn’t follow IMO. It was a tad bland I felt and basic salt and pepper would have improved it but with Mildred’s reputation they can do even better than that. I think they’re a really good choice and I would dine there again but I think they, with ease, could improve."
salads,Date of visit: January 2019,"Went there with a vegan friend, it's a small and cozy spot, they have daily chsnging salad bowls, we ordered from the alacarte menu but to be hon eee st salad plate was better than the other dishes"
Wonderful food!,Date of visit: January 2019,"A great spot to eat! Mostly vegetarian, but even for a non-vegetarian it was wonderful! Everyone in our party enjoyed it."
Fantastic,Date of visit: January 2019,Came here on a Saturday night around 4ish and it was rammed! No where really to wait without getting in the way. However the food was definitely worth all the waiting. It was delicious! Will definitely be coming back!
Amazing chicken....,Date of visit: January 2019,"My partner and I decided to see what the hype was about with Mildreds, we were not disappointed. I had the mock chicken which was very good, I honestly couldn't tell that it wasn't chicken. A very nice smoothie to go alongside my meal. The burger that my partner had was also very good. I would recommend this place to anyone, we'll be back!!"
Veganuary treat,Date of visit: January 2019,Nice atmosphere! Good menu - choice but not so much that you have to wait forever! I enjoyed the Mexican black Bean burger which was tasty - it’s all about the dip with the chips .You know that you can’t book but either get there early or enjoy a nice drink at the bar!
,,
quick lunch fresh salads,Date of visit: January 2019,"healthy, vegetarian, vegan and buzzy spot for a quick lunch, salad bar is cool, fresh tasty, burgers are not the best!"
Dinner,Date of visit: January 2019,"We know the restaurant does not take booking and we would have to wait. All in all we waited for about 50 minutes or so on Friday evening. Had a glass of wine while waiting, organic wine but honestly we weren't very impressed and it's a pit pricey £7 for a glass! We had halumi burger and Mexican black bean burger which was good. My husband ordered normal fries and I ordered sweet potato fries. Eventually we both got sweet potato fries, not a big deal but you want to get what you ordered. Even though I likes my halumi burger I found it a bit too oily and too salty. I understand they need to make vegetarian food tasty and that's probably the only way. I don't think we will be returning as there are quite a lot of vegetarian restaurants in Soho and other areas and we like trying different food. However, I am happy we went as it was not a bad experience. Trendy place."
We love you - amazing evening,>  >  >,"Great service, amazing food, a wine list full of organic wines, pretty good cocktails and nice atmosphere overall. My partner had a delicious bean burger and I had tofu and bean sausage with mash and gravy (with fennel, cabbage, onion). For starters we had artichokes and gyoza...everything was SO delicious. Recommend, even to meat eaters, you will not be disappointed. We will go back!"
Lunch,Date of visit: January 2019,"Me and my girlfriend had a lunch here which could be passed for a dinner, there was so much food . We had a starter, a main and dessert and all the way through the meal, the food was delicious and the price was very good for the quality of the food. Lovely staff too."
Vegan burger,Date of visit: January 2019,"This is a very cute vegetarian cafe in London, the food is good, the vegan burger is very popular, but too oily not the best!"
A veggies delight!!!,Date of visit: October 2018,
Team drinks & dinner,>  >  >,
Fantastic food & ambience,Date of visit: January 2019,
"Great food, fabulous ""meeter and greeter"".",Date of visit: January 2019,"We waited for 30 minutes as the place was full and bookings are not permitted, which I actually think is a great idea. As a vegan I was excited about trying this restaurant, and we were not disappointed. Our meal was fantastic and the service good .. coolly delivered, but good. My favourite person by far was the owner (?) who met us when we came in and then seated us after our wait. Very professional and very likeable .. He was glorious! Highly recommended restaurant, cannot wait to go back.Note to self next time - Remember to not be surprised that a tip is already included in the bill at the end."
Fantastic veggie/vegan food and outstanding value,Date of visit: December 2018,"This was my first visit to Mildreds and I was blown away. My wife is vegan and I am flexible but I must say the food here is excellent We stated with gyoza which were lovely, then I had the mock chicken burger in a black bun, the burger was succulent and flavoursome and the chips perfect. My wife had the mushroom pie, also wonderful. Finished with a lovely vanilla ice cream With our meal we had a soft drink, a couple of glasses of wind and a cocktail and the bill was around £60 - fantasticWe’ll be back soon"
,,
Can’t say enough good things,Date of visit: December 2018,"We just adored this place. Our group was two vegans, a pescatarian, and a flexible omnivore. We ordered a number of items, both individually and to share, and every dish was better than the next. Even the fries were spectacular (and, coming from Belgium as we do, that is meant as high praise indeed!). We ordered dessert even though we weren’t really hungry, just for the sheer pleasure. The service was also quick and very friendly. Can’t wait to visit London again and go back!"
Excellent Vegetarian/Vegan Restaurant,Date of visit: December 2018,A real gem in London. Great vegan / vegetarian menu with delicious dishes. The service was quick and friendly it's my favorite veg/vegan restaurant in London.I would highly recommend coming here.
Let down by the staff,Date of visit: November 2018,"This is a great little restaurant that provides a great choice for vegetarians and vegans, both for food and drinks.Unfortunately however, apart from one server (petite, Asian - apologies didn’t take name), staff gave brilliant impressions of not wanting to be there nor be polite when crossing paths with customers! Because of that, I’ll choose one of the many other restaurants around."
Surprisingly good vegan food,Date of visit: December 2018,"Not being vegan or veggie, I was sceptical but left both full and satisfied with the tastes. Had a half hour wait for the table so tried some cocktails which were good. Nice menu, with many good choices. I tried gyoza, the broccoli and the 'chicken' burger. All were excellent. Price was reasonable for central London. The many vegan customers in the restaurant were wildly excited by the choices on offer judging by comment around me."
Good Food and Service,Date of visit: November 2018,Really Enjoyed our food here - I am new to tripadvisor and really wanted to give these guys a heads up and say well done with the food but maybe improve on the service
Really good food!,>  >,Mostly Vegan menu but if you are vegeterian or not. It doesn't matter. This places is for lovers of flavors. We had a big surprise coming here. Burguers are really good!!
Fantastic!,Date of visit: December 2018,"I took my partner to Mildreds, as there are very few Vegetarian/Vegan restaurants around where we live. This place was amazing; great cocktails at the bar, friendly staff, and amazing veggie/vegan food. As a non veggie, I was concerned about the menu, but I need not worry! Excellent choices, wholesome food, very tasty and great service.I would highly recommend coming here. A half hour wait was not a problem for me, as it shows it’s popular!"
"Rude waitress, average service vague menu",Date of visit: December 2018,Had lunch at Soho Mildreds. I ordered the chicken burger. Was not mentioned in the menu that it was deep fried... I asked to change my order as I can't handle deep fried food a minute after the waitress left the table. To my surprise she also most refused to change my order although it didn't get to the kitchen. Luckily the manager agreed to help.I was disappointed with the service but was forced to leave a tip! This was part of my bill. I believe I would have gotten a better service if tip was not mandatory!
Tasty vegetarian food,Date of visit: December 2018,"I had a veggie burger which was very tasty, as were the chips that came with it. The service was quick and friendly. When I had to send a drink back due to an allergy to one of the ingredients which wasn't mentioned in the menu, the waitress exchanged the drink without any issue. The place was very busy and therefore quite noisy as it is small. Be prepared to wait for a table if you go there at lunchtime, but that's no surprise given their good food and central location."
My favourite restaurant in London,Date of visit: November 2018,"I love the food at Mildred's, it is now my favourite veg/vegan restaurant in London with the majority of the menu now vegan. The only downside is its always so busy! I wish you could book for small parties. Even my non-vegan friends love this place."
,,
Great Vegan restaurant,Date of visit: December 2018,Lovely restaurant with a great vegan / vegetarian menu. There is no booking policy - we arrived at 5.30pm for pre-theatre meal and took the last table. By the time we left at 7pm the wait time was well over an hour so arrive early! The food was excellent - the menu is predominantly vegan with some cheese dishes. We shared crushed avocado with tortilla chips and goyza dumplings for starters - both vegan - both delicious! My friend had the bean burger and i had a starter mac and cheese with a side of broccoli that was drenched in garlic which i loved but could still taste this morning! We shared a really good bottle of organic sauvignon - which i enjoyed so much i will be sourcing to purchase.
loved our cocktails and the food was pretty good too !,Date of visit: July 2018,stopped by for lunch on a Tuesday and there was a small queue but we didn't have to wait too long before being seated. i'm a meat eater and my daughter is vegetarian. i was very impressed with my choice and thought it was all very good value for money. definitely would return next time we are in london.
Tepid food.,Date of visit: December 2018,"Have been to Mildred’s before and thought it’s was ok, adequate if you will. It’s hard to find decent vegetarian and vegan restaurants as it is. This time really disappointed. We all had the mushroom wellington which was the Christmas dish. It took about 45 mins to come and when it did arrive the individual items on the plate ranged from tepid to cold. It’s a continual gripe for me but why can’t these restaurants get the food hot? For £15 I would expect to get a hot lunch as I didn’t order the salad. As it was such a long wait we all just ate it as couldn’t bothered to wait another age for an actually hot fodder to be placed in front of us. Don’t think il be heading back in any hurry put it that way."
Amazing Food!,Date of visit: December 2018,"A fab restaurant - great atmosphere, food & friendly service. The gyoza, curries & brownie are immense! Always full to the brim but so worth the wait for a table."
"Good food, great service.",Date of visit: November 2018,"We are 4 omnivores and a vegan - all work comrades.I am now a 'reductionist' apparently. I was looking forward to trying this. There was a lot of choice and we all tasted a bit of each others - it was all delicious.Everyone had a good meal here. We all thought the service was particularly good. It was a Monday night and the place was very busy with a few tables having 2 and 3 covers - so it was lively and bustling which added to the good atmosphere of a Soho restaurant.I had the hot faux chicken burger which was really good. The mushroom pie I had a bite of was also very good.We all enjoyed it and will return for our next get together. I would go back in a heartbeat and I recommend it to you too.If you want to explore vegetarian & vegan eating to see how good it can be, this is a good place to start."
What a delight!,>,Enjoyed a great meal and service. Food high quality. A real hidden gem and would highly recommend. Great ambience.
Meat Eaters can be satisfied,Date of visit: November 2018,"I'm a meat eater, but colleague is a veggie. Popped in for a late lunch today. Pleasantly surprised with the menu. Had the not chicken burger - i'm guessing a quorn type burger. Very lovely. My colleagues had halloumi burger which too looked very nice. Good job veggies, plenty of food to not shock the system:)"
Great food and atmosphere,Date of visit: November 2018,"I met up with 3 friends in Soho on a Saturday for lunch. We were not sure where we wanted to go until one of the group said that they had heard about a vegan/ vegetarian place that had good reviews. We decided to try Mildred's and we were not disappointed!We arrived at 12.30 and the place was heating so we did not think that we would get a table, only to be led upstairs to a table by the window. There was plenty of choice on the menu, but 3 of us opted for the buffalo 'chicken' burger with sweet potato fries and the other the pie with some extra dumplings. All I can say is that we loved our food and all emptied the plates! One of the best vegan meals that I have eaten in a while.I cannot leave a review without mentioning the cocktails. They were amazing! We had 3 different cocktails each and loved every one.Would recommend this place and will be visiting again next time I am in town."
Amazing vegetarian restaurant,Date of visit: November 2018,"Fantastic experience, whenever in London I always drop by to check their new options (menu changes, so there is always a new dish). Very nice staff!"
Great vegetarian menu,Date of visit: November 2018,"We arrived at 6 on a Saturday evening. The place was packed and the wait was 45 minutes. It was worth the wait. The food was yummy, the service quick and friendly. Highly recommended."
,,
Best Vegetarian Restaurant Ever!,Date of visit: November 2018,"I am not a vegetarian, but I do enjoy vegetarian food, so I have eaten at a lot of vegetarian restaurants from Boston to Silicon Valley to NYC....Mildreds was hands down the best Vegetarian restaurant I have ever had the privilege to visit....please open in Boston.This is a restaurant that you will love the first time and can go back over and over and over and over again!"
My favorite vegan place in London,Date of visit: September 2018,"In my opinion, Mildreds has the tastiest, yummiest vegan food in London. Although it's not 100% vegan, they have a wide choice of vegan options. The food and the atmosphere is great. We usually go there early evening to avoid the queue which gets longer by the hour. As a starter I always get the dumplings and I'm a big fan of their burgers&sweet potato fries with chipotle ketchup."
Amazing food and great service,Date of visit: November 2018,"Arrived on a Tuesday evening, we were told it could be a 45-60 minute wait for a table but were seated within 20 minutes. Service was great from start to finish - waitresses were polite, friendly and as attentive as you'd want them to be - and the food was honestly amazing. As a veggie who normally opts for one of the two standard veggie options on a pub/restaurant menu through lack of choice, it was so refreshing not only to have so many interesting meal options, but to have a meal that was honestly so full of flavour and perfectly cooked. I had the mushroom pie and mushy peas and it was one of the best meals I've had this year! Will be going back here everytime I'm in London and recommending to friends!"
Don’t believe the hype,Date of visit: November 2018,"Yes it is vegan but that’s no excuse for overpriced flavourless food that really didn’t hit the spot. The roasted tomatoes were barely cooked, the hummus flat and lifeless and the least said about the ‘mock chicken’ in a dry charcoal bun the better. I will not be rushing back."
If you haven't been to Mildreds you haven't been to Soho.,Date of visit: December 2017,"Practically an institution in Soho, Mildreds has an amazing atmosphere and fantastic food. Doesn't really matter whether you eat meat or not, you'll enjoy the menu and it's seasonality. Also, some cracking cocktails, organic & gluten-free beers and some interesting wines too, whilst you wait for your table. I've been there a few times and is generally busy but that's part of the fun so embrace it and have a good time."
This is vegan?!? Would never know!,Date of visit: November 2018,"We headed to Mildred's on a Tuesday night, arriving about 6:45pm. The entrance/bar area was packed and were told it could be an hour wait for our party of 4. We were there to celebrate a special occasion and opted to stay. Were able to get a couple drinks from the bar and the waiting was not very comfortable as it was quite crowded and we were smashed up against the wall to stay out of the wall. I think it was about 35-40 minutes later that we were seated. We had spent our time pursuing the menu so were able to quickly order. We selected the gyoza, smashed avocado (guacamole basically), artichoke crostini and fries as starters. All were very good. Two ordered the 'chicken"" buffalo burger on a charcoal bun while I ordered the Soul Salad. The burger was really incredibly good, the hot version quite spicy! The Soul Salad needed something in my opinion, something pickled to balance it out-it was a bit bland and I didn't even finish it. It was packed with avocado, tomato, greens, quinoa and I wish I hadn't been disappointed. We also ordered the Black Lady which is a lemon drink with charcoal and it was lovely. Dessert was even better. It was so hard to believe the Chocolate chip cookie sundae was vegan. It had cookie dough, a chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and was Amazing! Others ordered the Apple Crumble and the Brownie dessert, both were also excellent! Forgot to say we were seated on the top floor of diners where there was only 4 table so it was nice, private and probably more quiet than the main floor. Our server was a lovely guy who took very good care of us. Even bringing a candle in my dessert for the special occasion!"
Great food,Date of visit: September 2018,We love going to Mildred's for the food The ambience is ok although to my opinion there could be less tables allowing for more space which will make it a bit more laid back. Last month on my birthday we couldn't go in as there were so many people it felt crowded. Otherwise great food and great service.
Great vegetarian dinner in a buzzy atmosphere and great service,Date of visit: November 2018,"I have been eating at Mildred’s for decades, and it keeps getting better and better. We went for a pre theatre meal tonight and it was delicious. Loved the fun atmosphere handled professionally by the young staff. Michelle, our waitress was on it, we had top notch service in a flurry of pre theatre west end madness. Impressive. Sri Lankan Curry was awesome!"
Excellent vegetarian food,Date of visit: October 2018,Mildred’s did not fail to impress when I attended for lunchtime service. The selection of food was great and each dish that I had was incredibly tasty. I would recommend the zataar tomato starter.
Great food!,Date of visit: June 2018,I eat meat and I still loved the food here. Service was fine and the prices are fair. It can get a little crowded.
,,
"An absolute treat, glorious vegetarian indulgence!",Date of visit: October 2018,"Mildred's has its' reputation for a reason. We arrived early evening so managed to skip the queues that were waiting as we left after our meal.I had dumplings to start. They were very good, well textured and flavoursome. The dipping sauce they came with was also delicious. For my main I had the chicken burger. It was one of the best veggie burgers I've had! Just the right amount of sauce within, a nice crispy coating and a very pleasant bite. I somehow found room for dessert and had cookie dough ice-cream, which was beautifully creamy and satisified my sweet tooth wonderfully.A three course meal was excellent value and was truly indulgent. Service was great and I didn't have a single complaint. I can't wait to go back again!"
Exceptional vegetarian food!,Date of visit: October 2018,"I had a really great experience at Mildred's last night. There were a lot of people waiting and I was told there would be a 45 mins wait. The wait ended up being more like 90 mins as the waitress couldn't find us on the crowd when it came to our turn but as soon as she realised, she worked quickly to get us a table and brought us complementary glasses of prosecco. The food was absolutely incredible. I asked what was popular and was recommended the Sri lankan curry, and I can absolutely see why. It was amazing. Such awesome flavour! Probably one of the best curries I have ever had. The place has a lovely ambience, staff are super friendly and although I only got to try a few things, everything I saw being served looked awesome. I will definitely be going back again soon. Firm favourite!"
"Such a lovely place, fabulous vegan food and great atmosphere",>,"We visited on a Saturday late afternoon and got a table straight away. The food choices are exciting and varied with plenty to please. We had the sweet potato and black bean burger and the exceptionally tasty, soul bowl, starting the meal with a decent portion of guacamole and tortilla chips to start. The food is extremely well priced - burger £8, chips £3, sould bowl £12. It was a refreshing change to see the menu stating that all dishes are vegan except where stated otherwise, instead of the other way round! The atmosphere was lively and informal and we throughly enjoyed our visit. Thanks Mildreds :)"
Great food but can get busy,Date of visit: October 2018,"Mildred’s provides a wonderful selection of vegan and vegetarian food and drink. The staff are invariably friendly and helpful. But, it can get busy at peak times and weekends and they don’t take reservations. IMHO it’s worth the wait or go after 2.00-ish and before 6.00-ish."
Great restaurant,Date of visit: October 2018,A surprise visit and a great surprise it was. Had heard about great food and not disappointed. Great food and friendly service
Amazing food,Date of visit: October 2018,This is one of my favorite vegan place in London. Everything from the food and the service is perfect. The place is always crowded so be prepared to wait but is it worth it !
Taste,Date of visit: October 2018,Had a great meal full of flavour and a good size portion. The greeter was efficent and friendly. The waiting staff fast and fun can highly recommend it gets very busy so you might have to wait but worth it.
"It's busy, it's noisy and it's great !",>  >,My wife and I joined the queue on Saturday opening . Dead on 12 noon we were let in and immediately seated. Service isn't hugely friendly but very efficient. The restaurant was packed and noisy but the food was excellent. My wife had the mushroom pie and chips and I had the chicken burger with chips. Just so tasty. Veggie or not it's worth a visit I reckon.
Horrendous service!!!,Date of visit: October 2018,"Arrived and was seated at bar side table where we waited for ten minutes without being asked if we wanted to order a drink. Once seated, we waited for 15minutes and again was not asked if we wanted to order a drink never mind food! It was not a particularly busy time.Waiting staff were were wiping tables and setting them slowly and did not even acknowledge the fact that we were constantly trying to get thier attention. We got up and left and were not even asked if there was a problem. Absolutley appalling... I will not be returning to this reastuarant to find out if this was a one off."
Let’s go vegan,Date of visit: October 2018,6pm and it was super busy. You can’t book here so get there early to avoid disappointment. The roasted artichoke starter was lovely as was the vegetable curry. Staff were great.Not so sure about the mushroom pie or the cotton cheesecake (despite the kumquats it was a bit tasteless) but overall it’s a very good advertisement for going vegan or vegetarian.
,,
Who needs meat?,Date of visit: October 2018,"I have been going to Mildreds since the 90's and it just keeps getting better. Todays incarnation is wonderful, busy, buzzy, fun and above all seriously tasty. The staff are very cool but friendly, I love them. The drinks are excellent, a great line in alcohol free cocktails is available. The food covers some fantastic bases, from very hearty burritos and mock chicken burgers (my favourite) to energising salads and exotic Sri-Lankan curry. Puddings and coffee are spot on too."
Vegan eats,Date of visit: October 2018,Came here as my girlfriend has recently started eating veggie/vegan a lot of the time. I was genuinely impressed with the food; ‘chicken’ burger and sweet potato fries were delicious. The drinks were great too.
Vegan Delight,>,"We waited less than 15 minutes for a table and were seated in a cozy corner of the room. Although it was almost 2 pm, the restaurant was incredibly busy. A carafe of water was already on the table. The Sri Lanka Curry was amazing. All the food I eyed at other tables looked good too. Highly recommend."
Never dissapoints,Date of visit: October 2018,"Another good lunch at Mildreds, so glad tofu fennel sausages are back on the menu! It’s that time of the year, only one complaint- bit more mash on the plate! Fried halloumi starter was real nice as well.Lovely service."
Amazing,Date of visit: October 2018,Great food and service. I had the gyoza and brownie. Didn't even feel like I was eating vegan. Must try!
Fabulous!,Date of visit: September 2018,"Lovely staff, excellent service and a superb range of interesting, quality dishes. Highly recommended!"
Lovely food overshadowed by overly assertive staff,Date of visit: September 2018,"I had eaten at Mildred's in Camden and really enjoyed it so when an old friend and I planned to catch up over Saturday brunch, I thought Mildred's in Soho would be perfect.How wrong I was.Despite the food being excellent, the entire experience was overshadowed by overly assertive (and almost pushy) wait staff who clearly wanted us in and out as fast as humanly possible. Before we'd even looked at the menu, we were asked by FIVE different wait staff if we were ready to order. All transpiring in a matter of 15 minutes.Look, I know Saturday mornings are busy and mostly frequented by harried shoppers wanting a quick meal, but when wait staff are almost screaming at you with their eyes to hurry on up, gulp your food, pay and get out, it sort of ruins your appetite, to say nothing of your conversation.Needless to say, my hopes at a decent catch-up with my friend were dashed as we spent most of our time grumbling about the attitude of the staff.I will never set foot in there again."
Perfect!,Date of visit: September 2018,"Loved the food, everything was perfect!good service and atmosphere, a fun place to sit, good music.. Highly recommended and we weren't even vegetarian"
Delicious and filling,>  >,"I went with my sister at 17:45 on a Monday night. The place was already full, we waited about 10 minutes for a table so had a glass of wine at the bar and then managed to order promptly and our food was brought out in very good time. We had shared the burrito and the 'chicken' burger with sweet potato fries. Both were delicious, the 'chicken' burger particularly so with the basil dip. I'm normally a big eater but we didn't manage to finish the scrumptious chips. I'm not a vegetarian but absolutely love eating here. Only minor drawbacks being space and not being able to book ahead."
Fabulous London Vegetarian,Date of visit: September 2018,"This super restaurant has been operating for years, and the food is so fresh and lovely. Great Service. The menu is both interesting and traditional and the staff are eclectic and professional."
,,
"GREAT food, OK atmosphere",Date of visit: September 2018,"Pros:- great food, I really loved every dish - good cocktail and drink selection Cons:- VERY VERY LOUD. Really my only complaint was how close the tables were and how insanely loud the rooms were... specially if you’re seated upstairs - we could hardly hear one another even when speaking loudly so maybe not a great date spot or if you’re sensitive to noise. - wait staff left something to be desired, seemed a little “annoyed” with our menu questions but this was only based off our server - I’m sure others are lovely.Good food, just so loud!"
Not worth the effort,Date of visit: September 2018,"We traveled from Oxfordshire to visit the Soho branch of Mildreds. Arriving just after midday we were seated straight away and within 20 minutes the restaurant was full.I am struggling to find anything positive to say about the experience. The food was OK although my smokey mushroom and ale pie was served lukewarm and was actually unpleasant but the chips were good!The restaurant is incredibly noisy, the tables are so close together it is difficult to get in and out and the one female restroom is not good.The service was quick but the waiting staff were quite surly and seemed not to want to be there which given there is a 12.5% service charge is a bit ironic.A disappointment to us but obviously very popular with the lunch time London crowd."
Energetic vibe and decent vegan food,>,After 3 attempts to eat here finally got it. Had to arrive at 4pm on Saturday to get a table. The woman running seating was very helpful. The 3 servers we had were friendly. But not to the point of making recommendations or comments about our dishes of choice. I had the veg burrito which was good. Not out of this world. The guacamole dip starter was good but served with the last chips from the bag. I don’t know that it’s worth the wait and many attempts to get a table. Many other options to get a great veg meal in soho.
My 50th birthday lunch,Date of visit: September 2018,I hoped this would be better to be honest. Travelling form Cambridge to try it as it was vegan based eating. We were seated with strangers and placed in a corner. Our waitress was as miserable as sin. The food was warm not hot and the portion size was far too small for the cost. The atmosphere was non existent - largely due to the waitress scowls! I MOST DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE IF YOU ARE CELEBRATING. They just seemed to want your money and for you to leave. I’m miffed I chose it for my birthday. Soulless mannerless and bland.
Just good,Date of visit: September 2018,"Quirky building and set up. Loving the fact it was predominantly vegan with options for vegetarian. That ticked my biggest box! The menu was pretty good. Lots of starters/sides and varied mains. Food didn’t take too long. When the food arrived it wasn’t hot at all. I had the mock chicken burger with sweet pot fries which was all lovely flavour but not hot enough. Service... unfortunately our waitress that day made our visit less pleasant. I hate to say this as the other staff were so lovely and welcoming and happy to help. Aw forgot our drinks, she was rude and clearly unhappy. My friend couldn’t wait to pay so we could just leave. But still, on the whole I was happy. Happy to be able to eat my plant based food at a cafe/restaurant. I would visit again in the hopes of a happier waitress."
Just nice,Date of visit: September 2018,"We ate at Mildred’s last night with a friend who is vegan visiting London. We were greeted with a welcome smile by a very friendly waiter in Red (cant remember his name) the atmosphere was buzzing and the place itself is very quirky and cool.We ordered food and drinks and this is where it started to lose its shine, our waitress was very moody, maybe even a bit hostile at times and seemed to be muttering under her breath the whole time. One of our drinks was completely forgotten (this was finally brought to us at the end of the meal by a much friendlier waitress who said she would take it off the bill as an apology)The food was Just nice, nothing special. Far too much mayo on the burger and most of the meal was only just warm so this ruined it for us unfortunately. I would possibly return to give another chance but is not somewhere I will rave about"
Bad surprise,Date of visit: September 2018,"I was super disappointed by the dinner, especially as the place was recommended by many people. The menu wasn't too appealing at first, but after having eaten I was tempted to go away without paying. Everything was super greasy and oily, the drinks were just tonic water and sugar (not concerned by getting smashed AT ALL, it was a £8.5 glass of tonic water). Also a lot of garlic or other spices/sauces covered all flavours, which makes me concerned about the base ingredients. Not tasty enough? Honestly wouldn't go back again. The service was fine, the girl was lovely!"
One of the best meals ever,Date of visit: September 2018,"Had a fantastic meal here. Was seated upstairs in a roomy, quietish area. Starters were nice, main courses were sensational as were the desserts. Had a lovely black charcoal mock tail. Fantastic food, great service. Thoroughly recommend this place. Looked very busy downstairs with a long queue but we were seated immediately."
Fantastic,Date of visit: September 2018,"Really tasty lunch, Sri Lankan curry and artichokes and hummus. Had to queue but not for long. Cucumber gin and rum cocktails were outstanding, as was the service. Definitely returning."
Awesome food for Vegeterian,Date of visit: September 2018,A must try Polish burger and a chicken burger. the atmosphere and the ambience is amazing. The food is very delicious.
,,
Really really busy!! Lovely food.,>  >  >,Visited mid week and everyone was still queuing out the door for a table. We are a family of 3 and we Shared a table with another 3 people upstairs that we didn’t know - necessity to keep waiting times down. Food arrived quickly. I personally had the sweet potato curry which was delicious.and gluten free.
A good find,Date of visit: August 2018,The food here is delicious with a good choice of vegan dishes. I always go back for the Sri Lankan curry which never fails. Service is quick once you get a table. Restaurant not very big but a good buzz and you can look to see what everyone else has ordered!!
"Some good food, below par service",Date of visit: August 2018,"Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience at all for a number of reasons, which are outlined here in this email. We were just disappointed with the treatment we received. I did not raise this at the restaurant yesterday because I just wanted to get out of the venue as quickly as possible as I left feeling angry and sad I became despondent:The negative attitude from staff was shocking. I have never been to a restaurant where altercations between staff members have actively taken place that I could hear arguments whilst I was waiting for food. The ambience of the meal was completely disrupted and really made us feel uncomfortable being and dining in the restaurant.At the bar, whilst waiting for drinks bar staff were explicitly exclaiming and one staff member said indirectly to a customer was leaving “why do I even bother”. That’s not the vibe or attitude I expect in any restaurant, and it made me feel anxious that staff were actively talking negatively about customers during service.I was intentionally ignored by staff, when I noted we were waiting over 30-40 minutes for our main course, to find other diners who sat down before us were eating their food. When I asked for help from the service staff, I was informed our main course order was “lost”. Despite being busy they did not take any care to acknowledge my existence as a customer. In fact, one staff member was so rude they didn’t acknowledge my request and did not come back to my table to let me know what was happening with the order until I had to ask another staff member for help, who also had an attitude towards me. I was appalled to be ignored and be spoken to like I don’t exist in that way - this was totally upsetting.The food was okay, with the starters and my partner's meal was fine. My chicken burger was very basic. It wasn’t anything exceptional and was average at best.I fully appreciate it was a busy service and with the bank holiday perhaps there may have been issues regarding staffing resources. However, politeness, sincerity and compassion go a long way and will enable customers to be more at ease."
6th time visiting -Best Vegan Restaurant!,>  >  >  >,"I have been here many times and its always packed!The service is great the food is fantastic Even the the burgers are good There is brunch and great cocktails and good wine list too|!Last time some one had their dogs here too!Its one of the best places if your vegan as all of the dessert are all vegan including the pavlova! What more can I say its a great place!I have been to the Kings Cross branch too and its lovely there too, actually a bit more spacious, but can you beat Soho for ambience no way!!!"
How to covert someone to veganism!,Date of visit: August 2018,"I'm not Vegan, or even vegetarian, but I was in London with family who were Vegan so we went here for dinner.The restaurant was popular and very busy so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but it was worth it.I had Caribbean (mock) jerk chicken and it was one of the best meals I have had in a long time; it actually tasted as if it was made from real food and the sense of processing was entirely absent. Even if you're not a vegan/vegetarian you'll be impressed."
The best vegan/vegetarian food in London,Date of visit: May 2018,"Every time I have visited here over the last 4 years, the food has been spectacular. Fresh ingredients, friendly service, always new and updated menus. It is my favourite restaurant and have never had a bad meal here. Cannot recommend highly enough"
So nice,Date of visit: August 2018,"This place is a gem, I have been twice now, and it’s been amazing both times. It gets a little busy, but you can have a drink and wait. Totally recommend."
Delicious vegan lunch,>  >,"Came here for lunch Saturday (18/8/18) and there was already a long queue outside even before the restaurant opened. Thankfully we did not wait long and we were seated immediately. The restaurant filled quickly however service was fast and efficient. We did not wait long for our lunch to be brought to our table. We ordered Sri Lankan sweet potato curry, katsu mock chicken curry, falafel salad and Jamaican jerk tofu. All these meals were delicious, fresh and light. We also ordered pandan panna cotta with lychees and raspberry sauce for dessert. This was delicious and refreshing. Our friends ordered the brownie with vegan vanilla ice cream and they said it was yum. We will definitely return here again."
An excellent night out,Date of visit: August 2018,We are not vegetarian but we’re advised to have a meal as part of a short break in London.What a great suggestion - you can’t book and have to wait for a table. The system for allocating tables is very good and we were seated within 1/2 hour.Time enough to enjoy a cocktail.The food was really good and we would thoroughly recommend the restaurant vegetarian or not!
Tasty and vegan,>,"Here, you can find tasty vegan dishes. I recommend you to book a table, and you will not have to wait 20min to get a seat. Also, it's a little bit tiny and noisy."
,,
Yummy lunch,Date of visit: August 2018,"The wait of 20 mins was no issue as we had a super nice strawberry, pineapple, apple and mint juice. Mains were the ale pie and katsu 'chicken', but could have had numerous other options. Overall very enjoyable lunch."
Ridiculously tasty,Date of visit: August 2018,"The best beetroot burger I’ve ever had, so full of flavour! Popular place but the wait for a table wasn’t long at all. This place will definitely become a regular haunt."
Delicious but very noisy!,>  >  >,"We were told to wait 20 mins but it was actually only about 5. It’s a busy and noisy restaurant but worth the wait. There’s a big mirror on the back wall so it feels a lot bigger than it actually is. Had the crostini starter and was really fantastic Smokey flavor, we loved it. They put a free bottle of water on the table automatically which is a nice touch. The curry was really tasty with a nice kick. My mushroom pie was great and loved the minty peas. The food came piping hot. We wanted dessert but they had run out of crumble (annoyingly) so we shared a chocolate brownie. The food is good and a bit pricey but portions are generous. The downside is the noise, yiu am barely talk to your partner."
"Great food, room for improvement when it comes to service",Date of visit: August 2018,"This was my third visit to the restaurant and each time the food is delicious and well presented but the staff don’t seem to be bothered with putting some effort to make the customer valued and welcomed. No one was checking on our food, no one was smiling and the staff wasn’t attentive at all. Perhaps one would expect a better treatment having spent over £80 on lunch for two including service charge! Or perhaps it’s time to find another veggie place with more pleasant vibes!"
A London institution!,Date of visit: August 2018,"I've been to Mildred's many many times now and have loved every visit. The menu is always good, the food always awesome, the wait staff always friendly and the dessert menu always way too tempting to pass up!It's such a staple in the London food scene - I'd recommend it to any vegan, vegetarian or omnivore. In fact, it's the place I take omnivores to show them good vegan food.Come eat here - you'll love it!"
Amazing food and drinks,Date of visit: August 2018,"We arrived at 5pm so didn’t have to wait long for a table. We ordered a mix of small and large plates and all were amazing. Some were definitely bigger in portions, such as the artichoke dish. Others like the halloumi were tasty but you just got two small pieces. The green falafel large plate was delicious. Also a great range of drinks."
Great vegetarian and vegan restaurant,Date of visit: August 2018,"Vegan restaurants can get in a rut menu wise. Mildred's has a wonderful variety of innovative dishes. We just ate there two days in a row and will probably go back before we leave. Roasted artichoke with eggplant, spicy dumplings, burrito, burgers. The soul bowl is a great salad with hugh chunks of avocado."
Always amazingg,Date of visit: August 2018,"always amazing, lovely, fresh veggie food with excellent service! Was gutted it didn’t open sundays so just watch for that. Awesome place. We love it."
"Mixed review - great cocktails and juices, food good and ambience was ok",Date of visit: August 2018,"Went with party of 6 on a Friday evening. Arrived around 7 and was told wait would be 30 mins. An hour and 15 mins later we were seated in the main room. Noise levels was too much to have any decent conversation. So asked to move outside and were accommodated. It was so much better outside and cooler too. Cocktails were good. Try the cucumber gin and tonic and innocent pear! Food was good nothing great - maybe I had expected more. We tried burrito, chicken burger, jerk tofu, salad and a few appetizers Service was good and friendly. As a vegetarian vegan venue it was good as we had vegetarians in our party. Not sure about returning as I know a few meat places that can serve equally good vegetarian food."
The BEST vegan and vegetarian place in London!,Date of visit: May 2018,We love this place! We have been to both Soho and Kinhs Cross and both were brilliant with attentive staff and a varied vegan and vegetarian menu. We picked the Woodland Pie as the main meal from the menu and it has been outstanding the last three times that we have been to the restaurant. The truffles are outstanding to finish the meal! Lovely place. Well recommended. GO and enjoy ;)

"Great flavours, service and staff",>  >  >  >,"I went here today with a family member. We arrived at 12pm not knowing how easy it would be to get a table (no reservation policy) and were seated straight away. You could just about get a table before 1pm, I’m sure this depends. We had 5 starters: The artichoke - I think my favourite !!- really yummy and full of flavour, the accompanying spread was so so delicious. French beans with smoked nuts and chilli - refreshing and the nuts added so much to the dish. Avocado dip - tasty and what you would expect. Aubergine with harissa and green sauce - sooooo yummy!!! Green falafel with tahini and lemon - to die for and had a really good kick. The staff were very friendly and the efficiency of the restaurant was superb. The only thing I would say is it does feel a little squished in there and I think lesss tables would give it a totally different feel."
Don’t rush to go here dead flies,Date of visit: August 2018,"I’m a veggie and for years the original Mildred’s was one of the only great veggie places to go to. I went yesterday with my boyfriend and have to say it wasn’t a pleasant experience with the staff making us feel they really didn’t want to be there. Upon ordering drinks we were given glasses with ice, lemon and a dead fly. I then had to get the waiters attention and he seemed shocked we’d asked for a fresh glass. We ordered three small plates of starters which took almost 25 mins to arrive; whilst people arriving after us were being given their starters which happened to be some of the same dishes. Service was slow, a real lack of attention and staff seemed to b3 busy ordering their own food for breaks. Disappointing!"
Great food but service was a little slow,Date of visit: August 2018,We went here for dinner in a Saturday and arrived early (5pm) as you can't book. We got a table straight away but it filled up FAST! The serving staff were a little slow taking our order but that's me being a little picky. We had three courses and each was amazing whether you are a vegan like my girlfriend or a meat eater like me! Prices are ok given it's London but a 12.5% gratuity is automatically added. Overall we'd definitely go back to this excellent little restaurant and most likely will on the same trip!
Not worth it at all and absolutely not worth the hype about it!,>  >  >  >,"2/3/2018So, it took an hour queuing to get a table, so we sent one of the girls ahead to take on the task!!We went here for a friends birthday, two vegetarians the rest more than happy with veggie food and have had quite a bit before.Firstly the drinks menu is a bit random and limited, we requested drinks and they did take a bit of time to get the drinks to us. Although the server herself was very smiley and happy to help.We ordered some starters, which were distinctly average. The grilled Manouri cheese was okay, the guacamole was quite tasty to be fair, however really don't know what was going on with the hummus and bread, that really wasn't that great at all.We ordered more drinks and they came back a bit of a while later and two were wrong, but save messing about we said it was fine, leave it as is.The mains were really not worth waiting an hour in a queue for. The burrito was bland and I've honestly done better at home when in a rush, just a heap of black beans and rice with little flavour and lacking fresh ingredients.The panko mock chicken was rather the disappointment, it was way over cooked and one of the girls had to make a concentrated effort to get her fork in! Chocolate brownie and ice cream for pudding was nice.I by the end of the meal was sweating my bottom off as they sat me centimetres from the fire, and was left feeling a bit deflated that this was what we got.As an average place it would be fine, but the rave OMG reviews just didn't ring true at all with this place. I won't be returning at all as it's not worth the faff and shoulder sagging food you get served."
Crazy busy but worth the wait.,Date of visit: May 2018,I love this place from the staff to the cocktails it's just amazing. Vegan food is delicious and knowing I don't have to worry about what's in it makes for a great dining experience. It's always busy in here so be prepared to wait and waiting with a cocktail is the best way to do it. Be nice to the staff as they are lovely and the service is fantastic. The only minor downside is the tables feel a little cramped together but it's worth it for the great food.
Well worth a visit- yummy!,Date of visit: July 2018,"Despite a short wait for a table, we really enjoyed our lunch. We were seated upstairs by a window, so kept cool. We enjoyed Sri Lankan curry, Burritos, a burger all the various sides including aubergine with Rose harissa- all very delicious. A selection of soft drinks and cocktails. Worked for Vegan's, veggies and everyone else! Well worth a visit."
Really tasty - surprisingly so!,Date of visit: July 2018,"Firstly, I'm not a vegan, or even a vegetarian so went to Mildred's with my daughter (who is vegan) with some trepidation. My limited experience and opinion of vegan food is that it's limited in its choice, a poor substitution for the ""real"" thing and generally pretty bland and uninspiring. Well what a pleasant surprise for me.We started with Gyoza and Hoummus followed by Mushroom and Ale Pie for me and Caribbean Jerk Tofu for her. All dishes were packed with flavour and texture and I thoroughly enjoyed everything we had. We got there early for lunch and within 30 minutes the place was heaving so they're clearly doing things well and have a great following. Will happily dine there again and would heartily recommend to all diners of whatever culinary persuasion. Finally, they were happy to keep bringing bottles of tap water without prompting which more than satisfied our thirst so we didn't need to order any additional drinks. This helped keep the cost to a very reasonable £40 given the location in the heart of London's West End."
All kinds of YES!!,Date of visit: July 2018,"A menu where the options are listen as non-vegan, versus vegan...are you serious? I was capable of eating so many things on the menu that I was disappointed I only had one night. That said, our next trip to London will surely include a return to Mildred’s in fun loving Soho.Just eat - I had a nibble of food from different plates and they are all good!"
Amazing,Date of visit: August 2017,"Always yummy, keep going back. Best veggie place in London. The cashew curry is my fav. It’s always busy but worth the wait."
Loved this place,>  >,I went here on Saturday after seeing lots of pictures on Instagram and lots of good reviews. I went here on my own. The place was buzzing. I had an amazing lychee daiquiri with gyzo dumplings and green falafels. Even though the restaurant was packed at lunchtime they didn’t rush me at all. Staff were all great. Will definitely return.
,,
Vegan treat!,>,My veggie friend and I (vegan) went for early dinner (5pm) on a Friday. We didn’t have to wait to be seated but did have to share a table.I had the ‘chicken’ katsu curry and he had the burrito. Both were stunning!! I really enjoyed the flavours in my dish. We followed up by sharing the vanilla ice cream with mango and caramel. Perfect!!loved every bite.
Delicious food and usually good service,Date of visit: July 2018,I would rate Mildred’s for veggies - a good choice of food but make sure you go off peak as the queues get very long.
Not to be repeated,Date of visit: July 2018,"We went to Mildred's because we are vegan. We didn't have ro wair for a table on a Friday night. It was light and airy insided, but extremely noisy. We ordered two starters, which were good, and our main courses all at the same time. The two tables, on either side of us, were then seated. The waiter did refill our water, without being asked to do so. Then, the problem started. The two other tables received their dinners, while we were still waiting for ours. We assumed it was because we had ordered starters. But, we kept waiting and others who had been seated after the two tables were also getting food. We ordered more fries as our two year old was hungry and we knew he would eat them with dinner. We asked about our meals and were told it was coming. Food kept coming out, but not for us. Finally, we decided to leave. We were told, again it was coming. Still more food kept coming out of the kitchen, but not ours. We all got up, and decided to leave, while my daughter tried to pay for the starters. The manager showed up, then. She said she was very sorry and she would like to get us our dinners, on the house. We said we were leaving and that we had been told that the dinners were coming and our toodler wouldn't wait any longer. She ended up not charging us for two of the three meals and the starters. The tables on either side of us left when we did, food was okay, Indian style spices, but not labeled as such. Turns out, the waiter had gone on break and didn't turn in our order. This all happened in over an hour and a half. The manager did what a good manager should by covering our meals, but she should also be watching to make sure that the tables were all being serviced in an appropriate amount of time. By the way, when we finally ate, after returning home with our carry out, there were no fries, the food portion was very small, and not very good."
Poor food and tired staff,Date of visit: July 2018,"Ok - this place used to be good. Now the staff are not interested in serving and the food is average, at best. I’ve had better vegetarian food from M&S food hall!!! My burger was dry and the chips soggy. Really disappointed after waiting 45mins for a table. Will not be fooled again. Very sad as I love the idea of a fresh vegan/vegetarian restaurant. This place misses the mark so many times...."
Good vegetarian restaurant,Date of visit: June 2018,"After shopping we decided it is time for a dinner; as I am a vegetarian so we did choose vegetarian restaurant. It is a very small place; with many close to each other little tables; no place for private talks. The choice of food is interesting. Vegans and vegetarians will be happy. Food is tasty and aromatic. We had polish and halloumi burgers- very good, artichoke starter was very small. I would not recommend fries. My no alcoholic cocktail Troys temptation was great, really good. It looks as it is a very busy restaurant. Prepare to wait for a table. But it is worth waiting."
Fabulous Soho lunch in private room,Date of visit: July 2018,"A massive thank you to Mildred’s Soho for a fabulous lunch yesterday. We booked the private room as there were 11 of us and the service was faultless. You managed to convince the 10 carnivores in the party that your cuisine was the best. All of us would like to return. We chose different dishes but the mushroom and ale pie, Caribbean jerk tofu (which I had and was amazing ) and curry were all highly recommended. Many thanks again."
Amazing Vegetarian Restaurant,Date of visit: July 2018,"We love mildreds, I've been vege 25 years and coming to London we always visit mildreds. All the starters are amazing, I had the curry as a main and it was superb. Food is very well priced, certainly the drinks are very good when you compare them to other places in London. Only drawback is the noise, it's a very small restaurant and unfortunately the day we went it was so noisy we couldn't have a conversation, not usually like this, just unlucky."
Kings Cross location,Date of visit: June 2018,We had a tasty breakfast at the location down the road from Kings Cross station. Friendly staff-would recommend
Delicious and friendly,Date of visit: July 2018,"Innovative and very tasty vegan/vegetarian menu with so much to choose from that we ordered several small dishes to share between us. A very busy friday night, but we only had to wait for 15 mins in the bar before a table was available. Very friendly staff, efficient service and reasonably priced. Recommended!"
a pleasant surprise for a carnivore,Date of visit: June 2018,"Three of us meat overs were persuaded by a couple of vegan friends to have lunch here. Despite out initial scepticism it was delicious with many choices (I tasted a few of the other's dishes). Good service and ambience. In fact we enjoyed ourselves so much, when in Camden Town a few days later we went back to their restaurant there. Equally good. So carnivores be not afraid -- you can have great food at a vegan place."
,,
Average food & OK service,>  >,"Me and my fiancé came here for a meal as every time we have tried to come here it’s been full. So lucky enough for us we came at lunch time on a Wednesday to try it out. It wasn’t busy at all and we grabbed a table at the back so we could feel the air conditioning as it was a hot today. We ordered water and the waitress left it on our table for us. We ordered rose wine and they did the same without asking if we wanted to try, they didn’t even pour it which I find weird in any restaurant. The organic rose was average. We then ordered our food, 2 portions of gyoza’s and jerk tofu and leek and mushroom pie for our mains. The gyozas were a bit burnt (especially my partners) but tasted OK. (Pic is of mine)The jerk tofu was good and the pie was good. I have been mega excited to come here as I mentioned previously but I have to say the service was underwhelming and the food was average. Kinda disappointed to be honest but at least we have tried it."
Impressive food,>  >,"Very tasty and impressive food! We tried the burgers, it was tasty and filling but The ingredients were not very chopped(a whole half avocado put inside). For my personal taste a bit too fatty and greasy! One of us had the large plate with brown rice and tofu, good food but in the menu stated that there should be shitakee mushroom but there was not. The vanilla icecream very good, but the slice of mangos could have been more in my opinion. Because these reasons I didn’t give the max ranking. But definitely a must try for plant-based eater that visit London."
"Fab menu, lovely restaurant",Date of visit: July 2018,"It's so great to go to a restaurant where I had all the choice of the menu. I had the beetroot burger and my boyfriend had the mushroom pie. Oh wow, the food was delicious and I didn't want any dinner that evening, still full (in a good way). I like the fact that you cannot book a table, yes you might have to wait for a table (which we didn't, luckily) but if you want to eat good food then it's worth the wait. Service was good, attentive staff and it was busy. My only gripe (and it's with all customer service these days) the staff were obviously well trained in all things customer service EXCEPT for smiling. Please teach your staff to smile all the time, it shouldn't be the customer who instigates the smile. Minor moan and as stated previously this is not just at Mildred's. This restaurant is well worth a visit, and oh yes the cocktails were yummy too!"
"High expectations, big disappointment",Date of visit: June 2018,"Went there after wanting to try it for months. Waited half an hour to get a table (because I thought it was worth it), and sadly it didn't performed as expected. Ordered the stir fried veggies that lacked flavour, the dish was quite bland. My friend ordered the chicken burger which was heavily on the oily side and when telling the waiter that the food wasn't enjoyable he just replied ""some people don't like vegan"" (I am vegan, btw). To try to improve the overall experience, I encouraged my friend to get dessert which again wasn't enjoyable and had a bad presentation. Before leaving, I went to the bathroom..DISASTER! extremely dirty and in unsanitary conditions. I just opted to go to Pret's bathroom. I understand some restaurants can have bad nights, but the least you expect is a care for the customer and try improving things."
Wanted a light vegan meal with gluten free options,Date of visit: June 2018,Lovely atmosphere. And really like that they make tasty food. Great staff.But not a very gluten-free friendly menu. And when I asked for something instead they of crostini they offered blue corn chops with artichokes when I asked for an alternative like a bit of hummus they said that would be too expensive. I guess considering the options are so limited I guess I would have appreciated if they had tried to come up with a few options. And maybe consider generally that there are a few more people that may be gluten-free as well and cater a little more for them.
Wonderful and tasty food,Date of visit: June 2018,I'm so glad I decided to visit. The food was great and worth the hour waiting time to be seated. Staff were helpful and recommended options as I'm not used to so much choice.
Made me love vegan food,Date of visit: May 2018,"Okay, I'll admit it: I'm not vegan, nor am I vegetarian for that matter. I am, however, fairly health-conscious and when my vegan friends encouraged me to visit Mildreds, I was eager to try it out. I chose a vegan burger along with sweet potato fries (my favourite) and I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious and high quality the food was! I don't know if one should say this but the burger did taste very much like meat burger, and the service was quick and efficient. It's a shame there was no space indoors and we had to eat outside, but hey ho! Good company and good wine make all the difference!"
Great vegan dinner,Date of visit: June 2018,"Visited with my wife on a friday night. You cannot book a table, it’s first come-first served. We waited for 45mins, but that’s fine because we were actually expecting to wait more and had a drink at the bar.The menu has a wide range of vegan and vegetarian dishes for all tastes. The “fake” chicken katsu was absolutely amazing!The room is quite small so you might feel a bit squeezed, but that just adds to the overall very hipster experience - definitely recommend!"
First time vegan food,Date of visit: June 2018,"When my friend who I hadn’t seen for 20+ years announced she was visiting London for a few days, I was delighted. My only concern was where we could have lunch as she is Vegan and as I am not really at all familiar with Vegan diet requirements I asked google’s help. Mildreds was the first suggestion. I checked the menu and thought ‘yeah, this looks right and there are some yummy things in the menu as well’. I had the hallumi&aubergine burger and my friend went for the falafel with rice. Absolutely delicious food and great portion slze. She was impressed and I was relieved that i could treat her to something she enjoyed. Staff were very frienly, service was perfect and quick. My only criticism I have could be the noise. It was absolutely packed in the restaurant and therefore a little noisy."
Second visit,>,"Iv been twice now to Mildred’s while working away in London, both times have been delicious Iv tried the pita and guacamole starters and one of the burgers and the burrito mains, and also lots of the cocktails! The only downside is the long wait to get a table but that just goes to show how good it is."
,,
WHAT A DELIGHT,Date of visit: March 2018,"I was thrilled to be introduced to Mildred's vegetarian restaurant, via a Londoner. We arrived just before it opened at noon and were seated right away. It is a popular cosy place and it definitely lives up to its excellent reputation. The special healthy organic 'green drink' I had was lovely, as were our meals. WOW, WOW, WOW, is all I can say. The food was beyond delicious and we enjoyed every morsel. The Soul Salad was filling and satisfying as were our other meals. I only wish we had more time, so we could have experienced the dessert. The service at Mildred's was excellent. What a pleasure it was to find this exceptional restaurant. London has certainly come a long way in its tasty vegetarian choices. When I first visited London in 1970, as a student, Cranks, was the only game in town for healthy eating. Now, the sky is the limit. I cannot wait to return to Mildred's on my next trip to London."
An absolute must do for veggies,Date of visit: June 2018,"This was the most amazing and delicious meal from a completely meat-free menu. The choice!The blue cheese and leek quiche was to die for with piles of green salad. And then I met the ginger and rhubarb upside down pudding.....All my colleagues were very impressed with their meals, even the carnivorously orientated ones. Friendly service and no complaints at all."
Non vegan friends also love it here,Date of visit: June 2018,I eat in here very regularly. The food is always good and the staff friendly. This place deserves a special mention however in that it's probably the best restaurant to take non vegan/veggie friends as everyone loves the food.
Utterly delicious.......,Date of visit: June 2018,"As a non-vegetarian I was fairly unenthusiastic and sceptical about eating lunch here with a friend - how wrong I was to doubt that the food wouldn’t be equally (if not more) delicious as my usual diet. Grilled artichokes on ciabatta with garlic mayo followed by a mock chicken burger with delicious avocado dip both tasted divine. I will certainly return! We arrived at midday on a Saturday and managed to get a table (you can’t book) but when we left the queue was out the door, and I can understand why! It’s busy and bright and has a great atmosphere. Service was spot on - cannot fault a thing! £75 for 2 people for two courses with two glasses of prosecco each."
Delicious vegan food!,Date of visit: June 2018,"My husband and I were looking for restaurants with vegan options to have lunch, and came across Mildred’s. So glad we did! We had one of the best meals of a two week visit there! The menu was extensive and had some unexpected things on it, the service was attentive, and the food was absolutely delicious! I noticed they have a cookbook, and I may purchase it to try to recreate their food at home. Would definitely return."
Very good!,Date of visit: January 2018,"I had a lovely dinner here, and price was good considering the type of restaurant and the expensive area. According to my friend, this is one of the few places in the area where you can bring your dog in.The problem is that it's always packed, so getting a table is hard and you may have to wait a while"
"Food is fantastic, ambiance not so great",Date of visit: June 2018,"We were here a couple years ago. Food was and still is fantastic. We shared the Brazilian soup, hummus, grilled eggplant, and the Soul bowl. The soup in particular had such a wonderful melange of flavors. We came right before the restaurant opened at noon. Shortly thereafter it was full. Tables are quite close together and it gets really noisy. It detracts slightly from the food, but ambiance notwithstanding, we loved our meal here!"
Monday Lunch,>  >,"Been trying to get a table here on a weekend without any success but on a Monday off thought we’d give it a try and boom got a table right away Interesting menu with a mix of there normal meals and specials, something there for everyoneService was great we had an amazing waitress, friendly, chatty and attentive, all you could have asked forFood was lovely and tasty but thought the portions were a bit small for the price. Saying that we will be making another visit very soon"
Great Vegan Family Feed,Date of visit: June 2018,"Just visiting London for the day and dropped in for lunch-had two salads, a chicken (mock) burger, and dumplings. All excellent and Chicken burger was devine (per my daughter) - definitely will come back when next passing through"
Veggie’s Feast,>  >  >  >,"Walked into Mildred’s with three others without booking on a Friday at 6pm managed to get a table, we were informed that they needed the table back by 8.15, which gave us plenty of time. I was shocked that the restaurant was completely full by 6.45pm. The menu consisted of many different types of veggie / vegan dishes including chicken katsu curry (mock chicken). I ordered the vegetable stir-fry with brown rice and tofu, side of sweet potato fries and the gyoza for starters.  The gyoza we found undercooked, possibly because they were so busy. My sister who had had them before said they were normally a-lot nicer. My main was ok nothing special but very filling, i couldn’t finish it. The others on the table who had the katsu curry and goan curry seemed to really enjoy them. The restaurant is Good for vegans. The waiter was quite stroppy and intentionally left us waiting along time to pay the bill. Another negative for me is the restaurant has a unisex toilet."

Good experience,Date of visit: May 2018,I’ve visited here more than once and really enjoy it here. There isn’t much space but the food and service are good.. I love the range of vegetarian options on the menu.
Lovely healthy feel good food,Date of visit: June 2018,Visited on a weekday lunch at 12pm when they open and there was already a queue of 7 people waiting outside! We shared a large salad bowl and had Gyoza to share and it came to £16 for he both of us with the tip included. Very impressed with the freshness of the food and the servers were very friendly and helpful. Would really recommend to vegans!
Do not order the vegan cheese,Date of visit: June 2018,"After walking across London for 45 minutes, having seen excellent reviews of this restaurant, my daughter and I were deeply disappointed by our meal here. Both of us ordered the mock chicken burger with fries and vegan cheese, as we saw the dish being taken to other customers and thought it looked delicious. How wrong we were. We have eaten vegan cheese many times before at other restaurants, and found it to be perfectly palatable if rarely as good as the 'real thing'. This, however, tasted truly appalling, with a strong, synthetic, almost chemical taste which overpowered everything else on the plate, and which permeated every element of the meal, even when we had both scraped the cheese off the bun. Everything else was completely tasteless, especially the chips which were bland and greasy. It sounds like I'm exaggerating but we both also felt like we could keep tasting the cheese hours after eating it. I hadn't intended to say anything, but felt so unhappy at having to pay almost £40 for two drinks and two such unpleasant meals that I had to (politely) mention my dissatisfaction. The waitress agreed to take some money off the bill which I was grateful for and I do not have a problem with the service we received as the quality of the food certainly wasn't the fault of the waiting staff. It may be perfectly possible to have a lovely meal at Mildred's and perhaps we just made a very bad choice, but I'm afraid we won't be going back. I truly do not understand how anyone could eat what we did and consider it acceptable."
Great food with a cold shoulder,Date of visit: June 2018,"Went to Mildred’s for lunch. Had a craving for a great veggie burger and I wasn’t disappointed! I had the chicken burger and it was delicious. The sweet potato fries were homemade and really fresh.The atmosphere was bubbly but some of the servers let it down. The hostess was brusque and we didn’t feel like we were worth her time. Our other waitress just threw our things down on the table and barely acknowledged us. The other servers were really nice, so it was mixed. The service was automatically included in the bill."
Birthday lunch,Date of visit: June 2018,"I had a lovely lunch with my boyfriend at Mildred's. I am vegan and although he is a meat eater we both felt spoilt for choice as the whole menu looked delicious. We tried the tenderstem broccoli and gyoza dumplings as starters, and I had the stir-fried vegetables/rice dish whilst he had the burrito for mains - all super tasty! The service was great, waiting staff were genuinely smiley and sweet. Puddings are to die for - the polenta crumble was incredible."
Lots of vegan options,Date of visit: June 2018,Visited for lunch with a vegan friend. It opens at midday and the queue was down the street. The front part of the restaurant is a takeaway with huge bowls of salads etc. The restaurant is at the back with a nice sky light. Menu is nearly all vegan and lots of choice. I had a halloumi burger and my vegan friend had an artichoke based dish. The puds are great. Choc brownie delicious. Quite small inside and no lunch bookings so get there for midday to guarantee a table.
Excellent food,Date of visit: May 2018,"I visited on a Monday evening on the way to a concert. I didnt expect it to be busy but was lucky to get a table. The choice and quality of the food was excellent, hence it's popularity. The staff were attentive and efficient. Overall a great experience of my first time vegetarian restaurant."
31/5/18 Lunch,Date of visit: May 2018,"Arrived at 1230 for lunch for two, restaurant full, was offered a table to share but whilst waiting had a very nice cocktail. My guest and I had several dishes from the starter/ share menu-all 5 star and very filling. Staff although run off their feet were attentive and very friendly. As a meat eater I enjoyed all which was presented, will I return? a big yes!"
This meat eater rates Mildred's very Highly,Date of visit: May 2018,"We arrived early and there were plenty of tables but it soon filled up so when we left, there people in the street waiting for a table. Great atmosphere, and the cocktails were excellent - My Amaretto sour needed replenishment very quickly.Super service, super food, can't wait to go back again."
Go. Go now.,Date of visit: April 2018,"Non-preachy, delicious, great service restaurant that serves belly-rubbing vegan food with plenty of vegetarian options too. Try the Polish burger, it made me wiggle my bum as I ate it, it's so good. My husband and I went twice in April - he has already asked when we're going back. You can't reserve a table, so if you're someone that doesn't like to wait - don't go. Otherwise, order a drink at the bar, chill out and enjoy."
,,
Delicious Vegan Food,Date of visit: May 2018,"Having not been to many vegan places yet we didn't have much to compare to but everywhere online says this is the place to go, and we were really happy we made the trip. The restaurant is quaint with a clean modern feel to it. The staff are pleasant enough and are always on hand. The food choices were delicious and we tried several things between us including the burger and aubergine, and every dish was thoroughly enjoyed. The cocktails were different too which was great as we like to try different things. All in all we enjoyed our visit and would happily go again."
Great vegan food,Date of visit: May 2018,"I had heard a lot about this restaurant from vegan circles, and so was very excited to try it for myself when we went to London. We were lucky to get a seat, as the restaurant is quite compact and very popular. We were served fairly promptly but unfortunately the server forgot to bring my drink and we had to ask. We had the veg dumplings to start; they were amazing! My partner had the halloumi burger, which she wasn't very impressed with (the holloumi could have been cooked better and it could have included some more veg). I had the veg stir fry and it was very good. My favourite type of food, and it was cooked very well. I would visit again when next in London."
Best Vegan in London,Date of visit: May 2018,"What an amazing experience. All food is freshly prepared, to the highest standard. Menu selection is fantastic, and also enjoyed the Organic Vegan lager. Our first choice is the “chicken” burger...I dare you to say it tastes Vegan!"
Life-Changing Dining Experience!,Date of visit: May 2018,"I have been stalking Mildreds and planning my order since we booked our flights ten months prior to our trip. My husband and I went to the UK to celebrate our 10 year anniversary, timing our stay so that our actual anniversary day was spent in London proper with an upscale dinner at Mildred's in Soho. The thing about Mildred's is that there is often a very long wait, as they don't take reservations, and there is hardly any room to stand and gawk at the outcoming dishes. I'm here to tell you, it was worth every waiting minute.We began our meal with the Grilled Artichoke Crostini, perfectly cooked artichoke hearts drizzled with lemon over chargrilled rustic bread. However, the star of the show was the labneh, a yogurt-based cheese that they have veganized. It was so creamy and fresh I nearly licked the plate! That and that alone would have been worth it!For our entree's, I choose a Katsu Curry Chick'n, served with forbidden rice and sensible green vegetables. My husband enjoyed the burger, along with a sizeable serving of sweet potato fries. While we waited, I was so excited and eager to be there that I chatted up the hostess after she kindly remarked on my sequined dress. Though Mildred's is upscale casual, that wasn't going to stop me from glamming up for our anniversary night! I told the hostess how much I had been looking forward to our dining there, and that it was our anniversary, and after we sat she brought us two glasses of bubbly as a bit of an anniversary gift! It was so very sweet of her! Mildred's absolutely lives up to the hype. They are worth every bit of the street cred they get from vegans and carnie's alike, and my only complaint is that they are not in Las Vegas where we live. It was a life-changing dining experience!"
Favourite restaurant in London,Date of visit: May 2018,"I’ve visited Mildred’s three times now and each experience has been wonderful.It’s very busy with a lively atmosphere, so expect to queue for quite a while regardless of the day of the week it is, but if you grab yourself a glass of wine or a yummy cocktail and wait by the bar area it’s absolutely fine, especially since it’s well worth the wait. The all-vegetarian/ vegan food is SO flavoursome, reasonably priced and delicious, and the staff are lovely! Can’t wait to return very soon."
Delicious,Date of visit: May 2018,"This was my second time visiting Mildred’s. I couldn’t recommend it more. We waited for an hour for a table, the food was delicious, definitely worth the wait! The lychee cocktail was amazing. Will definitely be coming again! Thank you!"
Yum.,Date of visit: May 2018,"I love Mildred's though slightly prefer the Camden Town one which is bigger and a better shape to cope with the great business it (deservedly) does. I had delicious hummus with a crunchy topping and hot bread and then a chicken burger which was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and much nicer than one actually made out of chicken would be. My partner had a huge ice cream with caramel sauce, easily 2 regular portions worth. Only 2 gripes - one, no draught beer here which is a real pity. Second, it is really, really loud - I had to bawl at my friend barely 3 feet away and could hardly hear her in return. But I look forward to returning."
Filling,>,"An impromptu visit to Mildred’s did not disappoint! We ordered salt and pepper tofu to start which was great, the taste and texture along with the dipping sauce worked very nice together. We then both had the mock chicken burgers with garlic aioli and vegan cheese. The basil mayo which went with the chips was fanastic. All the staff were friendly, the restaurant had a nice feel to it. We left feeling satisfied and full."
Lives up to the reputation,Date of visit: May 2018,"You can tell why it’s so popular... all the food is bursting with flavour and tastes fresh. The inside is really lovely, nice and light with sweet decorations. It’s a perfect lunch place with friends. We all ended up having burgers but we all really enjoyed them! The ‘chicken’ burger was really interesting, there was a strong coconut taste but it worked. Someone else had the polish burger which had a lot of dill in it, wasn’t a fan personally but they really liked. Hullumi burger was apparently great. The ‘fries’ are more like chips which was a bit disappointing but they were still nice if you like chips. Basil mayo is so good!!!Only thing I would say is the waiting system is a bit annoying. Such a small area and you can’t book in advance so some people end up waiting outside and it’s a small, narrow pavement. Also the hostess was quite rude, considering she’s the first person you speak to you would expect ‘hi guys here’s how it works’ but you get a kind of snobby attitude like blank face but maybe she was just having an off day or something."
Super,>,"Delicious vegan food, excellent service and good vibe! Highly recommend! You can’t book a table in advance, but we went on Saturday evening and only had to wait 15 minutes."
,,
Great for Vegetarian and Vegans.,Date of visit: August 2017,"Great food and value. Fresh. Plenty of options. We all liked it, including the no-vegetarian family that I went with. They love it too. Sadly the place was very noisy."
Super busy but super nice,Date of visit: April 2018,"Worth the wait. Usually it's about half hour wait to get a table, but it's worth it if you've got the time. Can also order take away. The food is delish with plenty vegan options and great friendly service."
The best in London for Vegetarians & Vegans,>,"There are now a few great places for vegetarian and vegan food in London. But this is somewhere I’ve been coming for years. And it’s consistently tasty!It’s, unfortunately, not possible to book. This is the only downside to what is a cracking restaurant. The wait for a table during dinner service can be long. Lunch is definitely quieter. They do serve drinks and cocktails while you’re milling around though. Still, the trend of “no bookings” restaurants in London REALLY grinds my gears. I get it though. It completely negates the chance of no shows. Mildred’s now have 4 locations in London, so definitely check that you’re not closer to Dalston, King’s Cross or Camden. I’ve attached the menu for you to have a look at. But if you’re after his type of food...just go!"
Wish I lived nearer.....,Date of visit: April 2018,"This is my 4th visit to a Mildreds, other was the Camden one, and I cant get enough of their food. Awesome veggie/mostly vegan-ness. This time I had the burrito which was fabulous spiciness. Also indulged in the black forest brownie which I could eat every day. Pear mocktail was gorgeous. Havr had the polish burger before and so tempting to have it every time. Basil mayo to die for. Service is great - relaxed and unintrusive. You cant book but time it right and you will get a table straight away. Cant wait to return again......amazing food without cruelty. Go vegan!!"
Great!,Date of visit: March 2018,"We visited Mildred’s on a busy Saturday and were asked to wait at the bar. It was really busy and waited for around 20 minutes, which was fine as we were offered drinks. We were put on a communal table which was fine for us but probably not for everyone. Food was nice, I had the halloumi burger. I’ve had better though.Overall a pretty nice place and would return if in London again."
"Good, flavoursome vegan food",Date of visit: April 2018,"Had a really lovely evening at Mildreds - food has got a lot of flavour and quite a good selection of choices. Portions are big though - I struggled with a starter and a main! We tried gyozas and rice bowl with stir fried vegetables - both were very nice.This place is famous also for it's cocktails - they often change their menu and it's always got some interesting specials. Even in a weekday I would suggest booking in advance, or come early and get a drink while you wait!"
Wow! NOT TO BE MISSED! Whether you are vegan or not!,Date of visit: April 2018,"Delicious food, good sized portions, amazing alioli, organic wine and beer - who can ask for more! Lots of staff on hand that were very efficient providing excellent service. I would highly recommend Mildreds and will definitely be back."
A vegan & vegetarian oasis in Soho,Date of visit: March 2018,"We visited Mildreds one Friday night in October last year but the queue and therefore the wait (they don't take bookings), was too long. A good sign we thought, so we were keen to return. We are very glad we did! This time we tried an earlier time of 5pm on a Saturday afternoon. You walk through the bar to register with the host and then they give you a buzzer and rough wait time. Ours was 45 minutes so we settled into a cosy window seat with a fabulous cocktail. 35 minutes later we were being shown to our seat. The dining area is casual and if you're a couple, you'll be asked to share a four seater table with another pair at busy times. This lead to interesting conversation with people we'd never met before and only added to the experience.All the options are vegetarian but much of the menu is also vegan. It was so nice to have such great choice rather than the 1 vegan option you usually get to 'choose' from! We shared nachos and guacamole to start, a generous port and very tasty. From the mains we had a burger and chips and white bean sausage and mash. Both my descriptions here belie the true taste and excitement of these dishes. They were both superb and amazingly reasonably priced.Service was helpful, prompt and unobtrusive. Mildreds really did deliver on every level and we can't wait to go back."
Top vegeterian restaurant,Date of visit: March 2018,"Like its twin in Camden Town, this restaurant offers great vegetarian options in an informal environment. One of my absolute favourites for vegetarian food."
Great meal,Date of visit: April 2018,We visited on a Saturday lunchtime and were lucky enough to get a table - the queue wasn’t too big when we arrived just before noon but whilst we were at our table it got packed. Service was prompt but not rushed. I was looking forward to trying the new menu.I had the chicken burger with cheese and avocado and must say it was the best mock chicken I’ve ever had - it was moist but not at all greasy. The whole burger was delicious. I then had the Black Forest brownie for dessert - this is the best pudding I’ve had in a restaurant since Mildred’s stopped doing the chocolate peanut butter brownie. It was served hot with ice cream and the cherries went well with the chocolate.We will be making several return trips if we can whilst this menu is available.

Nice but my fiance cooks a lot better,Date of visit: April 2018,Was quiet excited about going as everyone was very thrilled and hyped about the place. The smashed advacado starter was good but the Sri Lanka Curry wasn't my taste. I liked the rice but the curry itself was so creamy I didn't finish my bowl which was a first in a restaurant.Maybe in a few years but for now cured and done
Good but nothing more,Date of visit: April 2018,"I don't really get the hype around this place. I mean, it was so crowded that there was a waiting list to be seated. I got a coconutty mocktail which was very good, and then the sri lankan curry, which was just a curry. Good, but nothing special or outstanding. Not worth the wait. Positive that most of the menu is vegan."
Great veggy restaurant,>  >,"Excellent food,well presented and very tasty, l recommended the Sri Lankan curry a nice bowl of food which smells and tastes of Asia, if you like a nice burger you have a choice of three the brioche buns are piled high.Cocktails can be sampled at the bar while you wait as it's a very popular venue, good value for money as it's central London. Great staff always smiling and helpful."
Fantastic!!,>  >  >,"Totally worth the half an hour wait! The bar staff were friendly and the drinks we ordered (kale juice and red velvet) were fab! We shared the tofu starter, gyoza starter, and falafel main and it was sensational!! The flavours in the rice were so nice and the little sips with the starters had so much flavour and the falafels were amazing and the almond they came with was divine! Our waiter was super lovely and knew exactly what he was doing so we will definitely be coming back!! Beautiful interior too!"
delicious food,Date of visit: March 2018,Recently visited this restaurant. Really delicious food and friendly service. I would recommend it to anyone especially if you are vegetarian. A good choice of organic wines and juices.
"Good food, awful service",Date of visit: March 2018,"We went to Mildred’s on a Wednesday afternoon, you would’ve thought it wouldn’t be too hectic, would hate to go on a Saturday! The service was dire. We were seated quickly, a lovely host, and a lovely table in the corner! We were both vegan and this place was a great option, as the ‘chicken’ burger with vegan cheese was fab! But, we waited 15 - 20 mins to order, the waitress kept making eye contact but didn’t come over to take the order. When she did, there was no, ‘hi how are you?’, no introduction at all! She just stood there and waited for us to talk. She took the menus before we ordered drinks. There were 3 tables around us who received their food before us after ordering a significant time after. We were actually scared to ask for the bill incase she bit our head off, we paid and left quickly. Unfortunately, this place misses the chance to upsell, I was never asked if I’d like another drink, no indication that this place does any desserts, and we weren’t even asked if we enjoyed our meal, or if we wanted any condiments with it. I think the management need to look at the sequence of service. The restaurant was full but the amount of covers isn’t that many, the service really needs to be improved. Plus, the menu says an optional service charge is added, but when you receive the bill it says compulsory."
Worth the wait!,>,"The busiest I've seen a restaurant in quite some time, we were told it was almost an hour wait for a table. We decided to wait at the bar and have a drink. Plenty of choices and I was happy to see plenty of non alcoholic choices that were more than just fizzy drinks and bottles water! The food was well worth the wait for the table. Both courses arrived promptly, hot and so so tasty. Definately will be visiting again!"
Amazing food,>,Long wait before dining but worth the wait. My partner and I had an amazing meal with great wine. The staff were really friendly and the food just espetacular. We had to buy the vegan book and now I will be able to cook there food at home. But I just can’t wait to come back. Hopefully I will find a time that is not as busy as this time. And I am not sure if I will wait that long again.
Delicious food,>  >  >,First visit to Mildred’s for us celebrating my birthday then on to the theatre I can honestly say its the best meal I have ever had & the organic wine was perfect Delightful place to eat & the staff are friendly & efficient My first experience eating out in a vegan restaurant & we can’t wait to go back again Get there before 12 o’clock when they open as you can’t book but so worth queuing for We we’re lucky to be seated straight away Thank you Mildred’s We will see you soon for sure !
Wow!!!!!!!!!!,>,"We visited Mildred’s after much searching online beforehand for a decent veggie restaurant in this area of London. We visited for Pre theatre lunch for my mums 60th birthday treat. There’s a no booking policy so we arrived just before 12pm which is when they open to find a queue waiting to go in. The doors opened promptly and within minutes we were seated in this small but very lovely restaurant. We weren’t disappointed - the food was amazing - two veggie reviews were best ever eaten - I’m not veggie but the food was fantastic and would eat here regularly if I lived nearby. Menu is vast and not pricey, lots of vegan food too. Will definitely visit mildreds again, the staff were lovely too, thoroughly enjoyable experience. Even if you’re a meat eater I guarantee you will love it"

"Great food, even if you're not a vegetarian",Date of visit: March 2018,"We met our son here this week and we all had a great meal. We chose a number of starters to share and that got us off to a great start - they were all excellent. Our mains were very good too, but the star of the show was the black bean burrito. That was excellent!We got in at 5pm for an early supper, but by the time we left the place was absolutely heaving. That's got to say something about the place. There was an enormous queue of people trying to get in. I don;t think you can reserve a table, so if you do want to eat there then get there early!The service was very good - our waitress knew plenty about the menu even though it had just been changed - and we'd have no hesitation in going back there again."
A great little find,Date of visit: March 2018,"My son found this place, as I'm vegan, and the menu was amazing. It's quite small and intimate, but a fantastic atmosphere. I was very happy to be given an allergen menu listing all the ingredients. When I went on their website I found they had other branches, and have already visited their Dalston branch!"
Excellent for Vegans,Date of visit: March 2018,"We walked straight in late afternoon for coffee and deserts. The only downside was the wait to take our orde but when it came we were not disappointed. We tried the chocolate brownie, pecan pie and Persian almond cake which was my favourite of the 3. They only offer soya milk alternative and the fresh mint tea and hot chocolate were both very good. Bill was £30 for 3 and service is automatically included. Not a huge place so I can see why waiting times can be a nuisance. But food is definitely worth going for."
Small plates,Date of visit: March 2018,"As others have said you can’t book, so daughter’s partner when ahead to nab a table - no can do. He did get a card and once we all arrived we were seated quickly. There were loads of people queuing. We had a section of small plates. I especially loved the grilled artichoke, humous and avocado with purple tortilla chips. Service from one waitress was a tad brusk, but otherwise we were looked after."
Lovely healthy food and a healthy bill! What’s not to like?!,>  >,"Started with the smashed avocado with lime and chilli and organic corn chips between two. For mains, I had the sri lankan sweet potato and green bean curry with roasted lime cashews, pea basmati rice and coconut tomato sambal.The bottle of Sauvignon Blanc was gorgeous. Yes, I’ve been here before and wanted to check the previous visit wasn’t a fluke. The only downside was the wait. Make sure you arrive slightly earlier than you expect to eat. We arrived last Saturday after 4pm and waited about 20 minutes. I guess good things come to those whom wait.My partner photographed our food and uploaded the attached photos to her Instagram."
Very disappointing,Date of visit: March 2018,Don’t know why it is so popular. We had to wait half an hour for a table and ordered two kiwi apple and lime juices. They delivered two glasses of froth containing about a fifth of a glass of actual juice and charged £4.50 a glass. I complained and the manager apologised and cancelled the bill. Not a good start. The food is Asian style and over complicated and heavy. Pak Choi served cut in two big chunks impossible to eat when grilled almost raw. Squash not properly cooked. Felt unwell after the meal.Do not recommend.
Gtreat vegan food,Date of visit: March 2018,Excellent selection of vegan food. Arrived at 2pm and it was packed but we only waited five minutes for a table. Service was quick and our starters arrived almost immediately- delicious hummus and artichoke crostini. The mock chicken and mushroom and ale pie mains were really tasty and big portions- may skip the starters or order a selection of small plates to share next time.
Excellent Vegan Food!,Date of visit: March 2018,"Excellent for vegans: finally they have a choice and can enjoy the menu. Plenty of vegan dishes, the whole menu is labeled vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free. Also, common allergens are listed. So, there is actually no need for the waitress to ask the guests again regarding their potential allergies... The food was fresh, creative, delicious and reasonably priced. Taking reservations would make it much easier for all involved."
Just not fun (waiting times),Date of visit: October 2016,"Like the majority of the one star reviews, from what I’ve read, this is just based on service and organisation. No food as we left.Arrived on a Saturday around 5pm, wet weather, busy. Table for two would be an hour so we waited, holding a hopeful piece of card with a number. This seemed to bear no relation to other cards and order people were called.The bar staff seemed not to be able to tell who was waiting first (ex long term bar staff - it’s a useful skill) so I got queue jumped. Managed to stay for a cocktail and water, reasonable price, nice cocktail.Bar area is just a corridor so constant bumping. Gave up after almost an hour when we’d seen other arrivals seated first and still had two tables ahead of us. At my age, life feels too short to pay to hang around on the off chance someone might feed me (at a cost)."
Buzzing with Tasty Food!,Date of visit: February 2018,Really Good! The place was buzzing and the huge queue / list of names worried us for a bit but we were seated in reasonable time and the food and service made up for it. Thoroughly recommended for delicious vegetarian and vegan dining. Wish we had a branch in Dublin!
,,
Best vegetarian food I've had,Date of visit: January 2018,"Brought a visiting friend to Mildred's, he is vegetarian and I'm a meat eater. This is hands down the best vegetarian meal I've personally had. I ordered the woo roasted mushroom & ale pie with mushy peas and fries. To say it was delicious is an understatement. My friend was equally impressed with the sweet potato and green bean curry. We thought it was fairly priced for a Soho restaurant and there was a nice atmosphere also. Highly recommended and I'l be back."
"Superb food, great little restaurant",>,"Visited Mildred’s Soho for dinner last night with my daughter after reading reviews. We were not disappointed. You can’t book so we expected to have to wait for a table. However, with a list of very reasonably priced cocktails on offer (average £7) we ordered a drink and waited - not very long as it turns out - maybe 10mins, that’s all. We were shown through to the restaurant - quite small, but the place was buzzing. All tables were full. It was quite “snug” but that just added to the ambience of the place. The menu was amazing - we were really spoilt for choice. There was so much we wanted to try. In the end we opted for a series of smaller plates so we could sample a wide variety. However you can order more traditionally, with a range of mouth-watering starters and mains. The food came reasonably quickly and we were not disappointed. I am not vegetarian (or vegan) but was impressed with just how tasty everything was. We didn’t have desserts - so full - but they too sounded (and looked) yummy. Staff were very friendly and attentive, without being over-bearing. We felt it was excellent value for money and excellent quality food. We both said that Mildreds will be first on our list the next time we visit London. Highly recommend. Go and enjoy!"
Oozing with Fresh & Zingy Flavours,Date of visit: March 2018,The menu is short but extensive. Good list of sharing /starters - ranging from chick peas in sauce to roasted aubergine and gyoza. The main course likewise had a good range - at least 7 of 'plates' and I really enjoyed the big bowl of stir fried vegetables flavoured with soya and miso and loads of nutty brown rice.
Average Vegetarian Food - Nothing Special,Date of visit: February 2018,"I went here last weekend with my two newly converted veggie friends and I think average is the fairest way to describe the food. We had around a 25 minute wait for a table which probably should have been less (I was told to go back to the bar and wait when I approached a member of staff, only to find someone else had taken my spot in the 'queue').Due to the size of the venue, you're seated incredibly close to other diners, with some couples even being seated on a table for 4 with another couple of strangers. Personally, this wasn't for me, and when our 3 mains and one side arrived, we struggled to find room on the table we were seated at for all to fit. The selection on the menu looked good, and we all went for different things so that we could try the whole spread. I had the burrito, which at £12 I was surprised to found came on it's own, aside from one salad leaf with dips on the side of the plate. As someone who tries a lot of Mexican food, it was a shame that the burrito consisted mainly of rice and beans and very little else. One of my friends had the veggie chicken which she said tasted very much of chicken which if you like that thing is great. The sweet potato fries we ordered for the table were really good and probably the best part of all our meals.As someone who's been a vegetarian for 20 years, I wouldn't rush back. The food wasn't memorable and the atmosphere not enjoyable. I'd heard a lot about Mildred's in the past which is probably why it struggled to live up to it's high reputation."
Mixed messages!,Date of visit: March 2018,"I have been to Mildred's before and will continue to go for the amazing food. The vegan chicken tenders is incredible as is the burger and dumplings, also nice generous portions for a good price! However, I went to the Soho branch yesterday to celebrate my birthday and certainly did not feel welcomed at all. We were seated upstairs where there was no music and therefore it lacked atmosphere. As well as this, the staff were rude and unwelcoming, not offering us a drink whilst we waited and not seeming at all friendly or liked they wanted to be there. I love Mildred's but would like to feel a bit more welcomed."
Kiwi romance,Date of visit: March 2018,"Blown away by the vegan food, we were given free tea as the air con was stuck on cold, overwhelming selection, will certainly go back!"
What is that mock chicken made of - chicken? :),Date of visit: February 2018,"Wow what can I say? We booked the private dining room for my daughters 25th birthday - we had vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters - everyone was blown away by the choice and quality of the food. The mock southern fried chick was amazing. A really great celebration evening - thank you."
Great vegan comfort food at a reasonable price.,Date of visit: October 2017,Mildreds was recommended to me by several vegan friends in London...so I had to try it out. I was quite happy with the basic menu of tasty comfort foods at a reasonable price. I would definitely give them a try again on any return visit to London.
Triple V: Veggie Vegan Victory,Date of visit: February 2018,"Ok your first impression isnt great, its a little place, you queue for ages squashed up in the bar area but let me tell you the food is awesome. My advice - take some drinking money and comfortable shoes and to fill the time up, maybe muse that by not doing online booking you are trapped there drinking in their bar :) £££. Nice.Ok, forget being played a bit in the bar area, the food is incredible! Literally every single thing on my plate and my partners was gorgeous. The ambiance is lively and noisy but despite the proximity of other eaters it still feels private. It doesn't get better than this the food is basically PERFECT. The waiters can be a bit dour but you would be too having to shimmy around all the madness to serve stuff all night."
Great Atmosphere & Good Food.,Date of visit: February 2018,Very busy and for a good reason. Food was really good. I’d recommend the artichoke for starters absolutely gorgeous. Staff were friendly but not so attentive as it was busy. We had to wait 40 mins for a table but we had a few drinks in the bar while waiting. Really nice cocktails and mock tails on the menu as well as organic lagers and wines.

Disappointed,Date of visit: February 2018,"We tried to get a table (as you cannot pre-book) when we got there we were told there'd be a wait of 90 minutes. We said OK but as soon as we made to leave a tab card was put into our hands and we were told ""you cannot leave, you have to stay in here"". Now I wouldn't have minded was it not for the fact that the place is so tiny you could barely move, it was super hot with the amount of people and would have probably taken 20 mns to get a drink (imagine a tube carriage in rush hour). I dont see why you need to stay when you could easily come back and if you're late the table is gone..although they wouldn't make money with drinks I suppose. For that reason alone I will certainly never go back. This is an unnecessary rule born out of greed only, shame."
Best Vegan Restaurant,Date of visit: February 2018,"I'm not a vegan but the food at this restaurant is outstanding. It is only a small restaurant so you inevitably always have to queue for a table but it's worth the wait. Do not let the busy bar area put you off waiting for a table here, the food is absolutely worth it and you never normally have to wait to long for a table."
Vegetarian/Vegan food at its best!,Date of visit: February 2018,"Highly recommend and will definitely be going back!! The Sri Lankan sweet potato and green bean curry with lime roasted cashews & pea basmati rice was amazing and the dessert....chocolate and hazelnut brownie with salted caramel sauce & vanilla ice cream was to die for. Even treated ourselves to their cookbook to experiment at home. Looking forward to visiting again. One tip...if there is a long wait/queue don't be put off, it'll be worth it."
A mushroom slice and oven chips?,Date of visit: February 2018,"My boyfriend and I went to Mildred’s last night before going to watch Les Miserables. Mildred’s was pretty busy but we got a table and both ordered the mushroom pie with chips and minted mushy peas. When the food arrived we couldn’t believe what was on the plate. A mushroom slice, 6 oven chips and a tiny amount of tinned mushy peas. This cost £12 each. We didn’t pay the service charge as the staff weren’t friendly and didn’t crack a smile. The sad thing is, it actually cost us less to go and watch Les Mis, less than £12 per ticket. Don’t go to Mildred’s, you’ll just be disappointed and feel as though you’ve been robbed; paying £12 for a quids worth of mushroom slice, 6 oven chips and some mushy peas....never again."
Great vegetarian - I even bought the book,Date of visit: February 2018,"I visited the Campden branch as I could not get a table at one of the other restaurants. But it was a good choice as there was plenty of space and air which made it very relaxing. The food was excellent - love when they know how to use spices to make the food interesting and tasty. The service was friendly and relaxed - the wine was ""so so""."
Lunch,>,"I visited this branch with my vegetarian daughter, smaller and busier than the Dalston branch, but still seemed relaxed; staff friendly, portions are generous - daughter tried the almond cake for dessert and said it was delicious."
Good food bad service,Date of visit: February 2018,"The food was great and good prices, we really enjoyed. However the staff were not great, I saw the waitress and I'm guessing a woman in management (tattooed) arguing and created an awkward tension. The waitresses that served us also had a disagreement over one of the questions we asked about a menu, just very unprofessional. We waited a while for the bill for our waitress to be in a foul mood. As I said food was great but think I'll go Camden next time."
Extremely busy,Date of visit: February 2018,"I can’t give this a true rating as unfortunately, we didn’t get to eat at Mildred’s as there was to be a 2 hour wait (which shows how popular it is!). However, from what we saw the food looked delicious, but the tables (of which there are few) are cramped together and you could see how this affected the staff (who looked very stressed under the conditions). Though our first impression wasn’t what we hoped it to be, next time we are in London, we will hope to return this time to eat!"
Good food and pleasant staff,Date of visit: February 2018,"Went for lunch on a weekday with a friend who was visiting London. We arrived about 1 but only had to queue for about 10 minutes for a table and they gave us menus to look at while we waited. Once seated our order was taken quickly but we noticed people who had come in after us were getting their food while we were still waiting. We queried this and the staff were quick to try to sort it out. One meal then arrived but there was a wait for the other one which was annoying. However, when we came to pay they had knocked a generous amount from the bill and the food had been excellent so we were very happy. There is also a takeaway self-servicebar at the front which looked nice."
Greedy shameless service,Date of visit: February 2018,"Got a bill 50.70GBP plus 12.5% (OPTIONAL as written on the bill ) service charge = 57.04GBP to be split into 2 of us. A waitress comes and I am asking to put 28.50 on my card. She pulls out her phone from a pocket and says it should be 2pence more = 28.52. I got paralyzed. I am pulling out the bill saying that 7.04 is optional and I do not get why she forces me to pay EXACTLY the total amount with 2pence accuracy. She said it is optional but she has to have full amount paid to close the bill. Diluted, shameless place where a client is a tool to make money and nobody cares about you as there is a queue at the door. I also share below comments and do not even expect anyone from the service be smiling or nice in chats. Tomorrow I am back to chicken shop as 20% is food but 80% atmosphere you consume your food in, which this place is missing."
,,
Could sparkle a little more...,>  >  >,"After suggesting this place to friends who were visiting London; 1 whom was a veggie, we headed over after work and waited the hour and 15 mins. We didn't mind as ""it is an experience"" to have tried Mildreds. Once seated, we have a comfy area at the back, where my friends could put their small cases under the seats, which was great. Anything bigger than ""hand luggage"" I do not know where they would put it so be careful when your going here. We had a gentleman server who did not seem to want to be there; even when we tried to have a giggle or when I asked ""What are your cocktails that come in a normal straight up glass"", for which he responded, very unfriendly, ""Gin and tonic"". That is whether the fun stopped. My friends ordered their cocktails, 1 of whom did not get their drink till around 30 / 35 mins after; which we had already ate our starters. Yes the drink was deducted from the bill but it's beside the point. Who has to ask for their drink more than 4 times?! The food came and it was delicious. The portions are always generous and I would strongly recommend the pie, ""fake"" chicken, and the stir-fry! Overall, it the food and ambience is great. Its busy, it's quirky and there was only one woman working there who seemed like she was actually glad to be there (or least it seemed she was). The staff need to know that funnily enough, customers aren't cattle in this establishment and a little smile would go a long way."
Delicious vegan food,Date of visit: February 2018,"We stumbled upon this place after searching for a good vegan place to visit for lunch and we were very glad we visited. We thought we’d be too early turning up at Mildreds before 12pm but when we arrived there was already a queue. It was easy to see why once we tasted the food. For starters we had the Thai coconut and mushroom soup and the smashed avocado with lime, chilli and tortillas. Both were yummy; they tasted fresh and were seasoned well. For the mains we ordered the wood roasted mushroom and ale pie with chips and mushy peas and the Polish burger with some fries with basil mayo. Our mains were delicious and we polished them off in no time. We also tried the passion colada mocktails which were really good. We would definitely visit Mildreds again and work our way through the menu as there are so many delicious options to choose from. Mildreds is place for a vegan or even someone who wants to try something different. We left feeling full and even took away their new vegan cookbook to try some great recipes at home."
Awesome vegetarian food,Date of visit: December 2017,I have visited a number of times and always found the food to be of a high standard and the menu varied to suit all tastes.
Delicious & Experimental,>,"Extremely busy and difficult to get a table but they catered for our group of 6 really well. We were sat in what would normally be a private dining area upstairs with another group of 4.Service was fast and the food was absolutely delicious even for the sceptical meat eater in the group! The starters and mains were all difficult to choose from and no one was disappointed. We shared a selection of starters as we couldn’t choose, they were all fantastic. I had the kimchi soup which was enormous and full of flavour! We will be back but may well try another branch in the hope that it’s a little less busy!"
Overrated !,Date of visit: February 2018,"This restaurant is overrated ! The food is decent but why such hype ! My friend had the Halloumi burger which was decent and I opted for another dish -which was decent but just bland!The service was efficient but not friendly -more of just serve the food, drinks, get the bill and go!As for the ambience - it attracts a nice crowd, but the place is very cramped - there are always queues to get in .....but honestly I really don’t know why!!There are plenty of other vegetarian restaurants around town that are better but hey try for yourself!"
Food poisoning!!,Date of visit: February 2018,"Never thought food poisoning was possible in a veggie restaurant. The speed of turn around of plates, food and tables obviously contributes to some sort of uncleanliness or lack of preparation of clean, fresh food. I had the stir fry and was ill for 2 days. One of the staff had a strong smell of body odour which, when passing us constantly and at close proximity due to the lack of space, put us off our food. Won’t be going back and it did not live up to the hype."
Tasty but overrated veggie restaurant,Date of visit: February 2018,"I always get excited when I find a veggie/vegan restaurant in a place I'm visiting and was really looking forward to lunch here.Despite being very busy, we were given a table as soon as we arrived and while the food was delicious, all of the dishes I ordered were cold. I returned my main for it to be replaced with another cold portion. Even though they took it off the bill, which was great, I think being so busy affects the quality of their food. It was like the food was on a conveyor belt. They brought me another cold portion a minute after me complaining about it. How was it ready so quickly? Was it sitting somewhere and they half heated it up?The service wasn't great either, they forgot to bring us our drinks, our mains didn't come out at the same time and I had to ask them to take off the optional 12.5% service charge on the bill after I complained about my food being cold twice.Maybe they just had an off day and it'll be interesting to visit again and see what my experience is."
A short lived love affair?,Date of visit: February 2018,"This is the second time we’ve visited and whilst the food is still yum, the service is anything but delicious. Obviously the place does good business and is constantly busy with a cue out of the door, but don’t expect to have a relaxing meal here. It’s very much conveyor belt service. Like I say, I did enjoy the food, it’s fresh and full of flavour, however the service is non existent. The food is just slapped down in front of you and nobody even asks if everything is ok or you need anything else. The empty plates are just as quickly snatched away and quickly replaced with the bill. No flies on this wait staff (but sadly not in a good way). However the real icing on the cake for me was the two utter pillocks, hogging a table for four, complete with luggage! And by luggage I mean ‘we got lost on the way back from the airport’ luggage. I appreciate this isn’t the staff’s fault, but surely they should have told them to move the bloody suitcases so other paying diners could comfortably get into their seats? The only time they were actually asked to move was when two other diners needed to be sat at the table and even then the two people, who can really only be described as idiots, were STILL reluctant to move their luggage. Even going as far as to ask the waitress if she could lug it upstairs for them, as if she were a bloody hotel porter! And what did the waitress do you may ask? She dumped the cases right next to me so I had to clamber over them to get out. Not only is this dreadful customer service, but it’s a fire hazard and I was totally gobsmacked the staff thought this was ok?! The two stars are for the food and that alone. I doubt I’ll be back for a third visit sadly, I’m not a fan of the arrivals at Heathrow vibe."
Busy place for Lunch but Delicious Food,Date of visit: February 2018,"We googled ‘best homemade vegan soup in London’ and here we are! It’s a small place and very busy both on takeaway and in the restaurant but it’s well worth a visit! We ate the most delicious coconut vegan soup followed by some small plates - Hummus, broccoli and a butternut squash and spinach plate - all were absolutely delicious- and a reasonable price too - just £42 including 2 glasses of organic White House wine! Fantastic lunch place. Ps their new Vegan cookbook looks fab and we ordered it on Amazon - special pre-order cost of £17!"
Busy busy busy,Date of visit: February 2018,"Excellent food but the 55 min wait at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon was excessive with 2 ‘starving’ teenage girls! Very cramped once inside. Food was good, good choice and served quickly, hostess was faultless."
,,
"Good, reasonably priced veggie food",>  >,"We visited the Soho branch on the last Saturday in January. I do really like this place, but unfortunately do a lot of people meaning it's always very busy! The menu is varied. It features the usual crowd-pleasers such as halloumi burgers and burritoes, but also offers up dishes as the Tokyo Bowl which marries black rice and a purple, pickled egg with aubergine, shichimi edamame beans and a jug of miso. I didn't have this main, but it looked delicious and had a great colour palette. I had a curry which was delicious. The portion size was very generous too. For me personally, it's slightly become a victim of it's success. The tables are squeezed together so you have to pull them out to get out your seating area. Service is quite hurried and impersonal. Don't get me wrong, I'll 100 per cent go back again but probably at off-peak times."
Still good but extremely busy (maybe 3½ rating?),Date of visit: February 2018,"Visited for the third time in a year, at the same time of day, immediately after the noon opening time. Managed to get seated, just before the huge queues waiting for a table started forming (booking not possible except maybe for large groups). The vegan food is still good, but some dishes have become noticeably smaller, and possibly a little expensive for what you get, for example the good main dish Soul Bowl salad. This may have been just our chosen dishes however as we noticed that some other customers' plates were quite substantial. The roasted miso aubergine starter with ginger and spring onions was good but might have been better with soy sauce rather than miso, but that is just a preferential taste. Pumpkin pie was good, but certainly no match for the chick-pea juice pavlova which they used to do and is now sadly not on the menu here. Tables inside are a little bit cramped together (my previous two visits were during the summer when we were fortunate to get a table outside - there are only two). Still worth a visit if you're a vegan, but we may try one of the other branches next time."
Exceeded expectations,Date of visit: January 2018,
"Vastly overrated, but i will say they are not greedy- reasonably priced",Date of visit: January 2018,
Delicious vegan food,Date of visit: January 2018,
"Good food, very busy, kind of slow",Date of visit: January 2018,"I've been to Mildreds several times - one time on each of several visits to London, and I'm surprised that I never wrote a review before! The food is good, but not the best in London, and the restaurant is very busy with tables too close together. The service is on the slow side - it seems they are overwhelmed by the crowd, and we did not go at a time that one would think is so busy. We went for a quite early dinner. The menu tends to be too heavy on the carbohydrates (lots of dishes come with potatoes, for example), so that I had fewer selections and ended up getting two starters and no main. My spouse can eat it all, and he was therefore much easier to please."
Birthday Treat,>,"We travelled from Norfolk especially to have lunch here to celebrate a friends Birthday. Absolutely delicious food, that was equally enjoyed by non vegetarians, lovely atmosphere and really good friendly service. Will definitely be back."
Veggie heaven,Date of visit: January 2018,We arrived at around 5.15 before it became maniacally busy. Tables are a bit squashed InWe were asked about allergies before ordering.Wine & beer by the glass. A very good set of options for main courses. I had Polish burger with sweet potato fries. Friends had a stir fry & the mock chicken & thought they were excellent Average main course £12 + drinks with 12.4% service automatically added on. Definitely a place to return yo if I can get in!
Birthday treat,>  >  >  >,"I wanted to take my mum somewhere special for her birthday and was told this place was one of the best vegetarian restaurants in London. They have a no booking rule which I love, just turn up and wait for a table. We got seated pretty quickly and started off with some passion fruit mocktails (which I could have drunk by the bucketful!) and then we shared a lovely starter of flatbread, mushrooms, black truffle, buffalo mozzarella and salad. My mum had the harissa hallomi burger and I had the mock chicken strips with sweet potato fries and maple coleslaw. I’m not a vegetarian but if no one had told me those mock chicken strips were vegetarian I wouldn’t have been any the wiser! They were amazing as was the harissa mayo dip that went with them. To finish we both had the peanut butter chocolate mousse cake and it was stunning, silky smooth and a lovely flavour through out. All in all this place is a vegetarians dream come true and I would thoroughly recommend to the meat eaters to give it a try as everything has so much care put into it."
Early vegetarian dinner in London,Date of visit: June 2017,I was told that if I don't get there around 6:00 pm I could easily get a table. By 6:15 all seats were gone. They have grown over the years.
,,
Great veggie food,>,"Really tasty, we had the polish burger the curry and the sausage with mash. Food was lovely but the portions are a little small (we were starving). Bit of a Moshe pit at the entrance trying to get a table and the bar staff did their best not to make eye contact. Once we were seated though it was great!"
Mildred’s Kings Cross,Date of visit: January 2018,"Food is great. I’d recommend the sweet potato curry. Prices reasonable. Bar staff not up to speed and other staff sitting at bar eating not very friendly. Serving staff were friendly, totally worked off their feet. Glad we got there before 6 because place fills up quickly. You can’t make a reservation unless in a group of 10 or more. We visited on a Wednesday and it was heaving with those waiting for tables - this is really a problem as you feel hemmed in. Some thought needs to go into this I think - it was very noisy - don’t go if you want to be able to hear each other. 2 people, starters and mains and 4 G&Ts came to £60 including tip which is added to bill. Tip: skip starter for pud - they looked lovely but we had no room or just share one starter. Didn’t stay for coffee - they do doggy bags."
Disappointed,Date of visit: January 2018,"Although the food was good. I was looking for a vegan place as I was spending the day in soho. I googled it and found this place.I tried the Sri Lankan sweet potato curry which was good. But I was really disappointed in the service. Never felt bad in a vegan restaurant like I did in there as my experience has always been warm welcome in different vegan places in London .they should make you feel comfortable. The organization was really bad, I felt I wasn’t welcome. They were very rude and kept telling us to “move”. I was taking my time when they came and told me to leave because people were waiting"
Great food - even for a meat eater!,>  >  >,"Visited here today with my vegan friend for lunch and we both loved it! We arrived at just gone 12pm (Saturday) and luckily seemed to get the last available table. We were sat straight away by a friendly waiter. We decided to share 2 starters, getting the gyoza and the miso aubergine. Both came fairly soon after ordering and were delicious and very good portion sizes. You get 3 fairly fat pieces of aubergine in a delicious sauce and 6 gyoza with a lovely dipping sauce alongside. I then went for the vegan buttermilk mock chicken with sweet potato fries and my friend had the stir fried veg with brown rice. We had to wait a little longer for our mains but this was understandable as the place was heaving and there was a massive queue of people waiting to be seated. The mock chicken was delicious and really tender. As a meat eater I’m hard to please when it comes to fake meat but it was honestly really tasty and the sweet potato fries were also really good and you get a lot of them! My friend really enjoyed her rice bowl, a very generous helping of it as well! We then both went for the peanut butter mousse cake with caramel sauce and it was amazing. Usually I find things with peanut butter to be quite heavy but this was so light and airy. And again a really good portion size! We both left feeling very full and happy. Our total bill - including 2 starters, 2 mains, 2 desserts and 2 non-alcoholic drinks - came to £58 and this is including service. I thought this was very reasonable for the amount of food we got and the quality of it! The staff all seemed friendly enough and we had no issues with the service. One bit of advice is definitely get there early! It opens at 12pm and we only just managed to get a table without waiting! You can’t book so be prepared to wait if you don’t get there soon enough! But it is worth the wait for vegans and meat eaters alike!"
Not a vegan but loved the vegan food,>,"Came here with my vegan cousin before Christmas, I'm not a vegan myself but the food was delicious! Had hummus to start and then a delicious beetroot burger and chips as a main.You can't book but as long as one of you arrives they'll assign you a number, and that number will be saved in the queue until your whole party to arrives.Definitely worth going to even if you're not a vegan!"
Fantastic Food.. Disappointing Service,Date of visit: January 2018,"Visiting Mildreds has been on my to-do list for a long time now, after being given the recipe book a few years ago. Excited to finally be there and to actually be looking at a menu where I could eat everything, I was left feeling disappointed after some abysmal service. There seemed to be too many members of staff and not a smile to spot between them. We had to ask to order drinks, which considering the lunchtime rush hadn't started yet was a little below my expectations. We ordered a small starter of olives to share whilst waiting on the mains, it never arrived. I asked/ advised the waiter of this when he brought our mains, I was met with a grumble of something along the lines of that he would look into it. He never came back to our table. Oliveless and slightly frustrated we tucked into our mains, which were fantastic..!! Not a bad word to say about the food, if the rating was based purely on the food, it would be 5 star. When we went to pay, I was going to ask to take off the automatically added gratuity of 12.5% as they had done nothing to warrant such a tip but didn't have a chance to blink before the waitress had picked my card from the table and used contactless.. Pretty sure 1. You're supposed to be asked whether contactless is ok and 2. Be shown the card machine so you know they are charging the correct amount. Lastly, we were never once asked whether our food was ok and we were enjoying our experience.. perhaps a lesson in customer service is needed for the staff?! I was expecting so much and was so excited for the visit and the service has left me not wanting to go back."
"Good food, terrible service!",Date of visit: January 2018,"Came for lunch today with my girlfriend as we’d heard great things about the food here. The restaurant wasn’t particularly busy and we were one of the first to be seated....but then completely ignored as several other people were seated and then served after us. After finally placing our order with what seemed to be the world most miserable waiter, we were disappointed to find they forgot to bring our starter out (and didn’t apologise either.)The food that did arrive was delicious and arrived piping hot, so no complaints on that side.Just a pity that the staff seemed uninterested and not very attentive, especially when a 12.5% service charge is automatically added to your bill."
Mildred’s Soho,>,"My partner and I had just arrived in London and were looking for a bite to eat. Easier said than done for vegans. However, wondering off Oxford Street we fell across this gem. First experience of vegan ‘fried chicken’ and it was fantastic. Also a great selection of cocktails to please any pallet. Lovely place with a great atmosphere and equally good staff. 100% would recommend !"
Top Class Veggie Experience,Date of visit: December 2017,"Having visited Mildred in Soho in the past, it was great to find their restaurant at Dalston Junction. We were able to pre-book for a party of seven vegans/vegetarians and found the venue to be spacious, clean and buzzy, with an eclectic mix of patrons. We were well attended by our waiter who offered helpful suggestions. All the starters that our party sampled were delicious. For mains, we ordered the broccoli with chilli and soya sauce, smashed avocado with corn chips, the mushroom and ale pie, with mushy peas and fries and the burrito with black bean burger. All are fully recommended as everyone was impressed with the quality and taste of their meal. For desserts, the pumpkin pie was to die for. Overall a great outing."
Amazing vegetarian food!!,>,"I am not a vegetarian myself, so I was quite critical to say the least to go eat in a vegetarian restaurant. Boy... was I wrong. I can say this: If I could cook like this, I would be a vegetarian. My friend and I shared the aubergine burger with fries and the veggie burrito, and these were both amazing and full of flavour. It is small though so it can be so busy you cant even get in (happened when we wanted to go back a second time) but its busy for a reason of course. Definitely would advise to go eat there, whether you are vegetarian or not!"
,,
Won't be returning - dirty plates and burnt food!,>,"Having last been to Mildred's 6 years ago and having fond memories of their burrito, we decided to make a concerted effort to visit once again. It's not like we haven't tried to visit, but it is always so packed that we have walked away at every attempt to visit since then. I really hate this trend of not allowing reservations as you really can't plan a night out.We arrived at 5pm and the queue had already started to form and then got really packed, really quick. As others have mentioned, the queuing system is ridiculous at Mildred's and they simply do not have enough space for this type of system - it's really unpleasant.We waited far longer than the '10-15 minutes' stated by the host but once seated in the uncomfortably cramped dining area, our order was taken quite quickly. The dining area itself is not a great space for having a nice meal out as you are practically on top of your neighbour, the tables are tiny and your chair is continuously bumped and jostled.As for the food, the gyoza are nice, but pricey. The miso-glazed aubergine was an utter disgrace. There wasn't a hint of miso flavour and three quarters of the dish was burnt (see attached photo). It tasted of nothing and I had to pour over my husband's leftover gyoza dip to make it edible. For mains, the southern-fried mock chicken was horrible. It tasted super sweet with a hint of lemon detergent - really unpleasant. The accompanying sweet potato fries were soggy and cold - the worst version of sweet potato fries I have ever tasted. I wasn't asked if I wanted any other sauces and didn't get the chance to ask as the waitress disappeared before we had the chance to ask. The burrito is smaller than it used to be and less flavoursome with mashed avocado masquerading as 'guacamole'. The quality here has definitely gone downhill.A lot of the wait staff are surly and miserable which adds to the unpleasantness (which makes the added service charge sting the wallet even more). However the thing that put me off the most is the dirty plates. The waitress handed my main course to me (she can't reach to put it down on the table directly as it is THAT cramped in the restaurant) and the bottom of the plate was caked in food. I then ran my finger over the rest of the plate that didn't have my meal on it and that was caked in food. This is really unacceptable and hazardous. The dishwasher clearly needs cleaning or too many dishes are being stacked in there and they aren't getting cleaned properly. The toilets are disgusting as well and there isn't enough closed space between them and the open kitchen door - really off-putting.Needless to say we will not be returning."
amazing veggie/ vegan food!,Date of visit: December 2017,"Amazing food! Lovely little restaurant which is always packed! Numerous veggie and vegan options, everything we had was delicious! Loved the variations of food, and there are definitely some interesting food combinations - loved it!Only negative is that we wish there was an option to book - be prepared to wait 45 - 60 mins!All in all, one of the best restaurants we've dined at, please seek it out! Would recommend to veggie/ vegan and even meat eaters!nb - best brownie we've ever had in our lives, absolute heaven!"
Meh,Date of visit: December 2017,"It's ok.Nice, clean restaurants & toilets.Service was good, waiters friendly and helpful and food didn't take too long.Food was meh. I ordered mushroom & ale pie and it was overly ale-y. It over powered all the over flavours.Would it recommend it? Probably not."
Best veggie food we’ve ever eaten,Date of visit: January 2018,"We arrived at Mildred’s yesterday evening and were greeted with a 45 minute wait. However, it was well worth it. There were plenty of places to sit, along with a bar with a varied drink selection. Once the wait was over, we were sat down in the restaurant and ordered the food. The dumplings, and pizzeta are unreal. Along with the halloumi burger for the main. The service was impeccable, there wasn’t any excessive waiting for food, and the staff were very friendly. Will definitely be returning again."
Great food,>,"Been meaning to go here for a while and finally managed to drop by! The place is really nice and cosy, with delicious food (especially if you have allergies, there’s loads of options). The only downside is that the wait is ridiculously long. You can’t book, so we had to wait for almost an hour, and the waiting area is very inconvenient (tiny and everyone walks through it so you have to constantly move)."
Loved it,Date of visit: December 2017,"Great food, great atmosphere, friendly wait staff. Didn’t mind waiting at the bar for a table, it was less than the hour we were quoted in the end. great night out."
Cosy and home grown,Date of visit: December 2017,An excellent vegetarian restaurant. The places is small and cosy and you may have to share a table too. But the service and food was top quality and the prices are reasonable.
Private party,Date of visit: December 2017,11 of us went there and used the private dining room for a 21st Birthday. Nice welcome and good service and the food was superb. Quite a few of the party had never tried vegetarian and they loved it. Great value for money and you can easily see why this place is so busy. We will return.
Not sure why I queued,Date of visit: December 2017,My nieces wanted to try this place. We had to queue for thirty minutes and then had to table share upstairs when there were two other tables free.The food was average and the staff were rude and disinterested.Had the polish burger which was nice but opted to skip dessert and go elsewhere.
Fantastic food. Worth waiting in the queue and moody staff,Date of visit: December 2017,"So we wanted to have a vegetarian meal and first choice on google and friend recommendation was Mildred. I called in advance and was told no reservation. They open at 12. We reached at 1230 and it was jam packed but thankfully we got our table on the first floor pretty quickly. The menu looked fantastic and we fell in love with the coconut Thai lemongrass soup. Maybe better than what you get locally in Thailand! We shared amazing small plates and could not fault the food. However the lady who waited on us was having a really bad day or was generally depressed. She scowled, maybe growled and just generally made us feel slightly uncomfortable. I had asked for a small candle on a dessert as we have a had a birthday person in our group. So I went down and spoke to another lovely charming lady who came instead and got our desserts and tea. She was the epitome of hospitality!So after reading all the reviews on queuing and staff, service. Don’t go if you have an issue with queuing. They don’t reservations. Deal with it. I felt sorry for the lady at the front dealing with so many people coming in the door.And if you get a rude staff. Speak to someone and they will replace or sort it out.The food is great. Just take the queuing and service with a pinch of salt. Or don’t go."

"Great food, friendly service requires attention.",Date of visit: December 2017,"My third visit to Mildred’s... Positives; seated within 10mins of arriving. 3 x starters were simple and very good - Gyoza, hummus and smashed avocado. The Soul Food salad was fresh and delicious for main, as was the mushroom pie. Sadly the service requires attention. I understand the staff are busy, however, there is a lack of genuine friendliness (with a touch of rudeness). I assume this is due to the repeated pressure of serving a high volume of customers."
Delicious and fun relaxed vibe,Date of visit: December 2017,Food is delicious. Wide choice to suit all tastes and appetites. Great service and fun relaxed atmosphere. Perfect place to catch up with friends for a fun and delicious meal.
Best vegan sweet potato curry,Date of visit: December 2017,"I absolutely love Mildreds. They are always super busy so there will be a waiting line as they don#t take advanced bookings. However, the service is quick and it's definitely worth the wait. I usually get the sweet potato curry, it's so good. they also have a variety of starters and fresh juices."
Amazing vegan and veggie meals,>,"Excellent service, seated straight away, food came quickly despite restaurant being constantly busy. Food was delicious. Great variety! Would recommend."
Best veggie in London,>  >,"We visited the Soho branch. Absolutely worth the 45min wait. We sat at the window with a glass of prosecco waiting and it was lovely. The food was full of flavour, we had the burrito with black bean and it was fantastic. We also order the polish burger. It was my favourite! Unfortunately no pictures of the brilliant food."
It was worth the wait!,Date of visit: December 2017,"We waited here for nearly an hour as you cannot book, but it was worth it. What an incredible place! It was really busy but the atmosphere was friendly. Despite how busy it was in there, we were served quickly and staff were really friendly. There were so many lovely choices and we ended up staying for 3 courses and a cocktail and was pleasantly surprised when the bill came to something that I would pay for in a chain restaurant. The food was mind blowing to say the least! The Miso Aubergine was cooked to perfection, the buttermilk, polenta un-chicken was absolutely incredible - I still cannot get over how delicious it was. The cocktails were really good and desert was incredible. I went for the vegan pumpkin pie with a creme-brulee type top. The ingredients were of excellent standards, even down to the olives.My husband is vegan and he enjoyed the luxury of having so many vegan choices to go for. We would love to come back again,"
One of the MUST vegan eats in London,Date of visit: October 2017,"This iconic plant based eatery combines classic British food with international and innovative recipes. Loved their rhubarb cheese cake, their burgers are simply great, and the vibe in the Soho's heart worth a visit for sure."
shame the service doesn’t match the quality of the food!,>  >  >  >,"The food is at Mildred’s is amazing, sadly the service doesn’t come close to being of the same quality. The food portions are huge, and full of flavour. The mock chicken is particularly delightful, even if you’re not vegetarian.Mildred’s is so busy that the staff seem rushed to serve you. There is no check back, no offer of extra drinks, and none of the staff look happy to be there. You’re made to feel they just want you to eat and leave. It’s so busy at peak times, you can see the staff getting flustered when your meal is taken to the table opposite....Be advised you can’t book here, so expect a wait unless you’re the first through the door!"
Easily became one of my favourites in the world.,Date of visit: November 2017,"Mildreds offers a great menu of delicious meals for vegans and vegetarians alike. Everything I've had there during my several visits was very satisfying (perhaps a little expensive). The staff was friendly and I just loved the atmosphere.Specifically, the Lexington Street branch is usually very crowded and generally not so spacey, but the food is always great in all branches."
Manic,Date of visit: November 2017,Food always good in mildreds but get in early if you are going for lunch.It gets hectic and can feel a bit squashed and on top of each other.Service is quick enough even when its busy but keep an eye out as it nay end uo on tge next table rather than yours
,,
A really pleasurable dining experience,Date of visit: November 2017,"Had lunch here today, arrived at 12.00 as my daughter said they get busy. By 12.30 the queue was to the door. I’m not surprised, it’s a small restaurant but the food was amazing.Although it’s all veggie my ‘mock ‘ chicken was delicious as was my daughters beetroot burger.The take away salad bar was really popular with customers and looked great. Would definitely eat here again when in London."
Fantastic Vegan Food,Date of visit: November 2017,"Love Mildreds! Excellent options for vegan and gluten free, terrific wine and cocktails, excellent staff and atmosphere! VERY busy but worth the wait!"
Who knew veggie food could be this good?,Date of visit: November 2017,"Everything we had was delicious. The staff are very friendly and the service is good. I would definitely go back. The only problem is the restaurant is quite small, so it feels a little claustrophobic. We were sat very close to the neighbouring tables."
Veg gastronomy,Date of visit: October 2017,"Veg gastronomy has finally arrived in London. This place shows the dedication and care that only professionals can show in veg handling. The results are astonishing. A pan-fried cheese dish with ''roasted'' grapes followed by a Sri Lankan sweet potato and bean curry gave the right international feel to a veg meal, you don't have to eat just tofu here !"
Avoid Peak Times,Date of visit: November 2017,"If you're heading here I recommend you don't visit at peak times. I visited on a Saturday evening and although the wait was only around 20 mins the place was very busy. This meant that the service wasn't great, often with staff forgetting our requests and our food arriving warm (as opposed to hot). The food still had flavour and the staff were very friendly, if you're a vegan visiting London I'd still recommend. I'm hoping to try a different venue at a quieter time as it gets quite loud."
Great food & vibe if you can wait,Date of visit: November 2017,"Excellent food, usually order a variety of small plates to share. Their takeaway service is good too. Great place if you don’t mind the wait and the noise. Not the place for intimate dining."
Vegetarian and vegan restaurant,Date of visit: November 2017,A maze of rooms over several floors. It became quite noisy when our room filled up but we didn't mind and the food and the service were very good. I rarely go for a non-meat or non-dish option but I was very happy with my dish and would order it again.
perfect for veggies!,Date of visit: November 2017,great range of veggie/vegan options...food quality is always up to the expectations...usually crowded but couldn't help...good things have to wait! :)
Excellent as ever,Date of visit: November 2017,"Visiting Mildred's is on my to-do list whenever I visit London, and over the years I've introduced many people to the deliciousness that is Mildred's. This time was the first time I got to go with my boyfriend. The food is simply amazing, so flavoursome and healthy. We opted for the mushroom and ale pie and the Sri Lankan curry, both were brilliant. Very reasonable prices considering it's bang in the middle of soho. Service is always friendly even when they're busy. Can't wait until the vegan cookbook comes out!"
Busy as usual!,Date of visit: November 2017,"I have been visiting Mildred's for over fifteen years. I had smoked mushroom and ale pie with delicious chunky chips and mushy peas. The black mojito cocktail I had was delicious. You can't book a table so you get a ticket and wait (an hour and a half waiting time at 6pm on a Friday). Couldn't fit in a pudding as portion was so generous but did manage to squeeze in the truffles! This is not a place to go for a quiet meal, you're packed in and it is very busy and noisy. Good service though."
,,
Such good food,Date of visit: September 2017,"Amazing options! Brilliant menu methodology - you can ask for a special allergies one which is marked differently so the staff know and double check with you, plus it is really clear what things you can eat!! The food was so good. Finding a vegetarian restaurant is amazing! I will be back often to work my way through the menu.They offer a cookbook- I might need it!!"
"Great food, even for meat lovers",Date of visit: November 2017,"I went to Mildred's with my family - all meat lovers. We ate almost everything on the menu :) and the surprise for them was that they were full on the end of the night. I, a vegetarian myself, fell in love with ""the fake chicken"" as the waitress called it :D Really, really great place for experimenting and trying out new things - even if meat is your one true love. And the staf.... just amazing - really laid back, nice and happy to help you out if there is something you don't understand on their menu.First thing to do next time in London."
"Mediocre food, unfriendly waitress",Date of visit: November 2017,"The food was so-so, some nice, some bland, some not in keeping with the menu (we expect mulled brandy cream to taste of something other than coconut). Several components of a salad were fridge cold, impairing the flavour big time and simply unpleasant to eat. Strange to see a cake made with dairy and eggs (according to the waiting staff) included in a mostly vegan menu. Maybe those raving reviews made us expect too much of the dishes, but in addition to the mediocre food was the waitress who couldn't smile if her life depended on it, couldn't even manage the basic niceties or simple good manners."
Late night meal after evening lecture,Date of visit: November 2017,"Even though it was a long walk, and we were starving by the time we got to the restaurant at 09:30pm, the food was fabulous. Vibrant noisy atmosphere helped us feel buzzing! We ordered one starter to share, and when they brought the wrong plate, they let us keep it for free, and so we ended up with 2 starters. Great start! All the staff were really patient and friendly , and all of them were willing to respond to our requests. Our mains, a sri lankan curry and a Mushroom and Ale pie were well cooked with fresh ingredients, and the plum crumble was good too.Finally have to say that we're not Londoners and would expect to have paid a lot for this, but it was no more than our crappy local pub charge!"
Not as good as I remember...,Date of visit: October 2017,"I returned to Mildred's after a few years - my last visit was over 5 years ago, and I am not sure I would go again. I think it is fine if you are around the area and want to grab a bite (they do not take bookings) but not worth the effort otherwise. Service is so so, and food is ok, but not a great dining experience...as a vegetarian I would have to rate 222 Veggie Vegan and Farmacy as the clear best places in London..."
Saturday Lunch,Date of visit: October 2017,"Bustling , rather crowded but very nice . The staff are excellent, the food is great. Gluten Free menu provided. Reasonably priced for Soho. We enjoyed our visit and would return."
Fantastic Food,>  >  >  >,"We went to Mildred’s restaurant in Lexington Street, before going to a theatre matinee. What a fantastic vegetarian menu they have. The food is excellent !The restaurant is small, so you are tightly packed in. All your party need to be there to get your table, so arrive at the same time. We arranged to get there 15 minutes after they opened and had no trouble getting seated. The staff are efficient and the ambiance great. There is a take away option, which is busy with enthusiastic clients."
Dreadful Customer Service,Date of visit: October 2017,"We have twice attempted to get a table here in the past. My daughter is vegetarian and some friends of hers had eaten here and loved it. The two previous occasions preceded theatre visits and so we were unable to wait the required hour for our table. So, last Saturday, October the 28th, on my daughter's 21st birthday we decided to go there for lunch and wait for a table if necessary. On arriving, at 12.15 and requesting a table for 3, we were told that we couldn't be accommodated downstairs, despite several tables for 4 being clearly empty. (The restaurant has a 'no-reservation' policy so these tables were open.) The staff member then led us upstairs to a poky, crammed room with plastic tables, led us to a table for six and told us that we would have to share with the next party of three.I politely (probably a little bit ingratiatingly I'm honest!) asked if please we could be accommodated downstairs in the sunny, atmospheric main room as it was my daughter's 21st birthday and as such, a special occasion. I was told that if we wished to eat there, then this was all that was available. We were not offered a choice to wait for an available table for three and the attitude was clearly ""take it or leave it"". We left it.This place has clearly become such a victim of its own perceived greatness that customers are now a secondary consideration to profit. Exclusively vegetarian restaurants are still rare but this niche market is expanding and as such will need to remain competitive. Mildred's clearly wants to pack each seat with a paying customer and as such, a table for four needs four paying guests to profitable. This attitude is so misguided. We could have been four diners on a budget who meant to spend the minimum possible or, as we were, a party of three who wished to celebrate with several courses and champagne. We ended up spending our money in Bill's and had a lovely time.I've read many reviews on this place and while still good, it's clear that Mildred's food and service are nowhere near special enough to justify the arrogance and carelessness of its staff towards its customers.There are so many brilliant places to eat in London, most now offering great vegetarian options. Mildred's 'You're lucky to be here at all' attitude needs to change before it's too late.So disappointed, and we won't be going back."
Form a line,Date of visit: October 2017,Mildred’s May in fact be wonderful. I will never know for sure. I arranged to meet people there for dinner at the ridiculously early hour of 6.30. I got there early and was told that the waiting time for a table was ONE AND A HALF HOURS. There is no booking in advance. Did I want to stand in the rain on the pavement drinking their wine till 8.00? What do you think?
Amazing Host!,Date of visit: September 2017,"I've visited Mildred's twice now and both times left very full and happy. But a great menu full of veggie and vegan delights is not just what stayed with me as a lasting memory...the staff are fantastic! This restaurant gets incredibly busy and the queues can be pretty long but the bar staff are great at making sure people get drinks quickly while they're waiting, and the host is the best I've ever encountered. She's friendly and bubbly, got an excellent memory for faces and really made my visits memorable as she makes each person waiting feel like they're welcome and valued, not just another person in the queue to remember.Thank you so much for your great hospitality, I'll definitely be back!"
,,
great for everyone!,"Review collected in partnership with this restaurant This business uses tools provided by Tripadvisor (or one of its official Review Collection Partners) to encourage and collect guest reviews, including this one.","lovely place- sometimes difficult for my vegetarian friend and i (HATE VEGETABLES!) to find places we both like- but this as a top pick on this trip! very cozy with great choices. you can sit an order from the menu, or take away from a buffet of salads."
Fantastic food,Date of visit: October 2017,"I always rate Mildred's highly for their food. I find their menu always has something interesting to try and each item is prepared to perfection. The only issue here is that the space is so cramped that getting in and out of your table is almost impossible and you will almost definitely knock over something on your neighbours table. They do not take bookings and at peak times you may have to wait a long time, they allow you to wait at the bar but this can get just as crowded as the dining room. The food is worth it, but it's not a ""linger"" restaurant."
London vegan/vegetarian institution!,Date of visit: October 2017,"If you are vegan, vegetarian or just like excellent food then you need to go to Mildred's! We have been several times and every time the food is nothing short of amazing. Their menu has something for everyone- from healthy bowls to delectable burgers, curries, stir fry...Desserts are also particularly good so make sure you go hungry!"
one of my favourite restaurants in London,Date of visit: October 2017,"Their meals are amazingly taste!!! What I ordered was ""coconut green currry"", which was so delicious! It was not too sweet but a bit hot, and sweet potatoes in the curry were soft and of course, sweet! Almost all the menu are vegetarian/vegan and some are gluten free, so it's friendly enough to those who cares about that!For the dessert, I ordered ""caramel pudding"". The pudding is vg/gf/raw, but the natural sweetness of caramel and cashews and the taste of the raw tart was super yum. I would try another pudding next time!!!・Things to concernIt could be too noisy inside to talk while eating, especially on weekends. It might not be a good place for a date or a serious situation.Also, the price is relatively high, so like students might be hard to afford to it. Even so, this place is worth trying!!!"
Left with a hungry belly and an empty wallet,Date of visit: October 2017,"Don't understand why this place is so highly rated. The gyozas were nice but at £6 for 6 it was a rip off. The butternut squash was bland and tiny portions. The burrito was also tasteless and tiny. Just rice in a wrap with some iceberg lettuce, plain sweetcorn and what was meant to be guacamole but was really just mashed up avacado. For £12 you have to be joking! We took so long deciding what to have because everything on the menu you could cook easily at home. The tables are way to near each other, the service was slow. Never again!"
The best variety of vegan food,>  >,"I want to try the whole menu! I've been dying for sausage and mash for ages but hate the fake meat sausages, so was so excited to try their 'tofu and bean sausages and mash', which didn't disappoint. Mum had a squash curry which she said was delicious. Their cocktails are gorgeous as they're not overly sweet, and they have such cool flavours - I had a pumpkin margarita! Best vegan dessert options I've ever seen too. The crumble is divine! Service was quick too, and the staff were really friendly. I'll be getting back ASAP to try as much as I can on the menu."
Vegetarian delight,Date of visit: October 2017,"I met with two very good friends for lunch in London, I have never eaten a vegetarian meal before until I visited Mildred's. Firstly the food was fantastic, second the it was great value and third the staff and the atmosphere was excellent. Highly recommend you try it out"
Oh dear,Date of visit: October 2017,"I’ve eaten at Mildred’s now for years and have always had a fantastic time, great food and service. We popped in on Saturday evening and expected to wait an hour for the table the lovely waitress said. That’s fine. Went to the bar to order drinks. 2 gin fizz. The lady making them spilt half the drink over the bar and was going to serve it by adding more ice. I said could we have full measures please at £7.50 a drink. They were delicious. We sat down on a sharing table order our meals gyozo dumpling and butternut salad. The salad arrived on what I could only describe as a plate smaller than a saucer. It tasted delicious all few bites of it. Then our 2 sweet potato curry’s arrived. I’ve eaten this again for years. Tonight was a huge bowl of rice, 4 pieces of potato and 2 French beans hidden under the cashew and coriander. I complained and this was deducted from the bill. I must say looking at a lot of the food being served the portions have diminished. You have a very loyal customer base don’t start loosing it by opening all these other locations and not focusing on what you already have."
So much choice .....,>  >  >  >,"The cafe does not accept bookings for small groups, so get there early. They open at 12.00 weekdays. The restaurant has a cafe-feel about it and as a vegetarian, I delighted in the big choice of vegan, vegetarian and organic food and drink. The service was quick, which enabled us to walk to our theatre performance in good time. The non-veggie person in our party loved her Polish, beetroot based burger and I chose the starter of smashed avocado with chilli and lime with organic corn chips. The only negative feelings I had were that it is very noisy, so not good for any hard of hearing friends and our server was very dour and didn't really speak to us - maybe he didn't like us? But they made the experience only slightly less than excellent. I will definitely visit again."
Decent  food at reasonable price,Date of visit: October 2017,Had lunch with a friend here recently. The menu is great with plenty of choice and portions are decent. For a central London venue it is reasonably priced. Service was average and the dining area is crowded. Would definitely go here again but it isn't quiet and you may end up sharing a table with strangers at peak times.
,,
Maybe we ordered wrong?,Date of visit: October 2017,"Everything on the menu sounded so good, we had trouble deciding. But everything we had was just ok - eggplant starter (which came with the entrees not as a starter - why?), beet burger, and tofu sausages (too salty to eat, for me). Everything was not quite hot enough. We were there early - around 5:15 pm and got a table easily. It was bustling. The servers were just not very attentive. We might give it another try - and order other things, and ask for them to be really hot. Really wanted to love it."
Very disappointed,Date of visit: October 2017,"Firstly, this restaurant doesn't take bookings so there was a mass of people queuing up to get a number so they could have the privilege of getting a table. This adds to the anticipation and is presumably a good ploy to get customers thinking they're somewhere special. As it happens we didn't have to wait too long.We were a party of three. I didn't have a starter but one had the manouri cheese and one the chargrilled artichokes, both of which were apparently very good. For the mains two had the stir fried veg and one had the polenta chicken. Both mains lacked seasoning and were pretty tasteless. Also, if it's supposed to be like chicken it should be moist, this looked and was bone dry, only redeemed by the dressing. They were meals we could have put together better ourselves.Looking at the reviews Mildred seems to sort of divide opinion. It may be popular because there aren't many veggie restaurants in London. Maybe the rest of the menu was fabulous and we just ordered the wrong things. Maybe people go because it's trendy. We decided not to complain but said we wouldn't go back. I may try Mildred's again in case it was bad luck but in a restaurant this popular EVERYTHING should be good. These places which are fashionable need to up their game otherwise too many customers will feel they have been ripped off. I've given the meal an Average rating only because of the starters."
Could do better,Date of visit: October 2017,Nice buzzy vibe with friendly staff but food a great disappointment. To be honest I could make a better burger & other dishes lacking in taste. Feel like it's trading on its name & not putting the effort in.
almost perfect,Date of visit: October 2017,"first visit to this legendary restaurant - why did I wait so long! Fantastic food, utterly unpretentious (even down to the pricing), really nice staff. the fruit smoothies are the best I have ever had, anywhere on planet earth. get in early, though: we went on Saturday: it opened at noon, long queue formed outside before then, full by five past. will definitely be back. A wonderful place for us committed veggies, and would also be enjoyed by the veggie-curious (or even the veggie-reluctant)."
Busy but worth the wait!,>,"My daughter recommended Mildred's above other Vegan restaurants so we thought we would give it a go. We were told it would be an hour wait for a table for 3 , we decided we had done enough walking so settled down for the wait. Just after we got drinks a table came free! 20 mins only. I had a mock tail passion fruit. Really refreshing. The dumpling starter was just great. Difficult to believe it was not meat but we were assured it wasn't. The burger with vegan cheese was good, rather large but even though the texture was spot on and the look just like a good meat burger I did not think the taste was interesting enough. The cheese was good but the beetroot burger just had something missing. Maybe just me as my wife and daughter loved it but were full up and unable to finish it. After a short break we shared a desert, a plumb and blackberry crumble with creme anglaise. All I can say is Amazing!"
"Very good, but don’t complain",Date of visit: October 2017,"Peak time(6ish) this place is very busy. Food is very good. My meal, stir fry, was served warm and I returned it. Attitude to me was bad, almost aggressive. So much so I said “be careful how you talk to me” this meal was only warm, not hot. Too much to ask? Waitress made excuses for the behaviour of her colleague to me. The staff are amateurish. Management need to work on this,as these guys let the place down. Such a shame, as I enjoyed what I had, albeit only warm. They deducted the cost, only after pressure, from the bill. Long way to go guys to make this a special place and give it legs when trade might start to drift."
"Good vegetarian food, very busy",Date of visit: October 2017,"Wanted to visit this place for ages so finally made it for a late weekend lunch in Soho. I arrived at 3pm and people were still queueing to get in. I was quoted a 20-30 minute wait but was actually allocated a table within 15 minutes. Seating is pretty tight and it does feel a bit hectic with so much activity. Staff were friendly and immediately asked about any food allergies.As a starter we shared a plate of gyoza with a chilli & soya dipping sauce, which were utterly delicious. My husband had the buttermilk fried mock chicken, which he enjoyed though he thought his coleslaw tasted a bit too 'healthy'.I had the kimchi broth with bbq tofu, which was nice but not groundbreaking. The charred pak choi in my dish was really great though. The tofu was quite flavoursome.Portion sizes were very generous. I had been worried that my broth might leave me hungry but in actual fact I wasn't able to finish it all.Service was a bit slow with the place heaving, and at one point I had to get myself a fork from another table after mine wasn't replaced.The small plate options looked really interesting - I think I will return at some point to try some of them. I imagine this is a great place for vegans."
I was reccommended this place by London vegans,>  >,"As I went there before diner time a got a place right away. I really was not disappinted, I LOVED their food. I had the burrito with black beans and red rice topped with melted cheddar, tomatillo jalapeno salsa, iceberg lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, raw corn salsa"
Finally!,Date of visit: August 2017,"I finally made it to Mildreds after years of walking past and deciding it looked too busy to get in.Mum and I made a lunch time visit whilst we were in London to purchase my wedding dress. I chose the soul bowl, whilst Mum went for the mushroom and ale pie. Both were absolutely fantastic! Despite being full, neither of us could resist the dessert menu. I went for the brownie, and Mum had the ice-cream with melted chocolate shot. Again, both fantastic!Now I understand why this place is always bouncing, but I will certainly make more of an effort to secure a table next time I'm in London!"
Great Vegan/Gluten Restaurant,Date of visit: October 2017,"Great menu. The Soul Salad and sweet potato fries were delicious. Friendly staff, very busy so recommend getting there early."
,,
Just average,>,"I don't know why people rant and rave about this place as based on my recent visit I just found it OK. On the downside, this place is very crowded and as conducive to a relaxed meal as a visit to a fast food joint, but twice as expensive. As a result of this don't expect anything but brisk service, the staff simply has no time for the punters, is a question of fitting them in mainly.Portions are on the small side too. My flatbread with halloumi would have been an OK starter, but not a main. Juices are also expensive and please note that what they mean by a 'small salad' is indeed the equivalent of a side dish. Flavours are OK, but nothing to write home about and the price/quality ratio is low. Clearly aimed at tourists mainly but they are obviously doing very well so why care?"
Crowded and ho hum food,Date of visit: September 2017,"We went to Mildred's because it was listed as a vegetarian restaurant, and indeed it is. However, the waitstaff was uninterested in helping us with any dietary considerations. For example, I didn't want the mushrooms added to a dish and I got them anyway. My rice dish (can't remember the name) was boring and looked like it was sitting in the kitchen for a while. My husband got a curry which he liked a little better. I wouldn't return to Mildred's."
Birthday meal for a vegan,Date of visit: September 2017,"Everything was served stone cold. Not tepid but cold. My mushroom pie was not only cold but when I sent it back for a hot plate of food, it tasted of one flavour - veg stock. Everyone's burgers were cold and the duck was also cold. My dumplings were tepid. People must be desperate to keep going to this place. When more vegan and vegetarian restaurants open I'm sure it will flounder."
Excellent food and fun atmosphere,>  >  >,"A friend and I visited Mildred's for dinner as part of a mini trip to London. When we arrived the place was absolutely packed, but having read great reviews we decided to wait the predicted 45 minute duration until a table became available. During our wait we got a bottle of the house white (lovely) and took a seat on the stalls near the bar. Only 20 minutes later were we seated- much less than predicted. The seating area is pretty cosy- lots of people in one area so it's also rather loud... but it has a vibrant busy atmosphere that gives the place it's spark and later on in the evening, it starts to die down a little anyway. The food was excellent. I had the halloumi burger which was divine and an order of fries on the side, some of the best chips I have ever had. The staff were very friendly and kind- good service."
Delicious Vegetarian Food,Date of visit: September 2017,"Good reviews and word of mouth lead myself and my girlfriend to this wonderful soho vegetarian institute on a Monday night. We knew the place would be busy even on a weekday but we were more than happy having a few drinks whilst we awaited our table. The staff were very attentive and we weren’t waiting long before being seated even though they were fairly busy.Choosing from the menu was difficult as it all sounds amazing, I would defiantly like to come back and try some of the other dishes on offer. On this occasion we choose the Mexican spiced black beans with feta, grilled pineapple and my partner the Halloumi chargrilled aubergine burger, both were really delicious. We also both really liked the Basil Mayo that they served with the chips a must try.Overall if you looking for a clean, modern, atmospheric, relatively cheap for soho vegetarian fusion restaurant with influences from around the world then Mildreds is a must."
Menu reads better than it eats.,Date of visit: September 2017,"Visited today about 5pm, very lucky to be seated instantly as a large queue formed after we arrived, wife ordered fake fried chicken with chipotle mayo and sweet potato chips, a bit dry for my tastes. My daughter ordered red beans with quinoa which i didnt taste but was informed had no flavour and I ordered Vietnamese fake duck with rice noodles and daikon which was a lacking in any real flavour, the fake duck was overdone and rice noodles so slimey that combined with the bizarre choice to provide lacquered chopsticks to eat with, rendered the meal impossible without reaching for the fork. I'm also pretty sure I was served sliced cucumber masquerading as daikon. The waiting staff seem to have a bit of an attitude too, my wife had heard pretty good things about this restaurant but cant say i would recommend it."
Great Soho Institution for Tastu Vegan Food.,>  >  >,"Mildreds is an institution in an atmospheric and attractive part of wonderful Soho. No bookings - so you often have to wait for up to one hour!The vegan food is excellent and the restaurant, although not romantic, has much more atmosphere than the newly opened Dalston branch (see my review). And the bill - well with really filling main courses (all at £12) this is very cheap dining by Soho standards. So although not cordon bleu vegetarian food (try Terre à Terre in Brighton for that and a much larger bill !), it is both healthy and nutritious vegan food (with beer, wine, etc). And finally, unlike Dalston, it is somewhere that you might go to celebrate a special occasion - I did, and totally enjoyed the whole experience."
Tremendous,Date of visit: September 2017,"I visited here after holding a survey on our Facebook page FCVFRIENDS to find the best vegan place to eat in London and Mildred's won.Not disappointed. Excellent place superb service and the food was to die for !!!! I had the wild mushroom pie,chips and minted mushy peas followed by the brownie and washed down with a vegan lager !!! Will definitely be back you rock !!"
Private dining room,Date of visit: August 2017,"Our party of 8 were booked into the private dining room for lunch on a Saturday for 2 hours. £100 deposit secured the room, and we booked in May for an August reservation. The T&Cs on the confirmation email says minimum of 10 guests or it's at managers discretion if you can remain in room - our party unfortunatly fell short nearer the time, but there wasn't an issue or mentioned that we might not stay in the room. It's a long table with benches in a cosy room upstairs. The service was quite slow and often wondered if we'd been forgotten about between drinks orders and drinks arriving, and then starters arriving (starters were only bread and oil/vinegar). We'd been there an hour when starters were bought out - i had to request the main hurried along as we had another engagement to leave for within the next hour. The food was quite delicious, most of the party ordered aubergine and halloumi burger with sweet potato fries and it was lovely. The only downside was once the bill arrived we were informed we hadn't met the minimum spend so the difference would be deducted from our deposit. However the minimum spend they said was £50 more than what was written in confirmation email. Perhaps this was a genuine mistake and the minimum spend raised in months since i booked, or perhaps it wasn't. But we argued the case having the email proof and they agreed to deduct the full deposit - but made it sound as though they were doing us a favour rather than adhering to their own T&Cs in the email. A disappointing end to a nice meal."
Horrific service,Date of visit: September 2017,"Utterly disappointed. Heard so many great things about Mildred's but left wishing we had gone elsewhere. We ordered the miso aubergine to start to share between two of us. This arrived promptly and was delicious. We put our cutlery on the plate after we finished. The waitress came to take the plate and aggressively swept the cutlery off the plate back into the table, making lots of noise. We were both very shocked and felt awkward after this. Our mains then took a very long time to come, at least half an hour after we had finished our starters. I ordered the mushroom pie and my friend ordered the detox salad with aubergines. The waitress noticed our mains had taken a substantial amount of time and came over to us twice to tell us they were coming. When they arrived the detox salad came with goats cheese instead of tofu which was then taken back to the kitchen and was changed quickly and my pie and chips were like warm. I notified the waitress who offered to take it back to the kitchen but I insisted to eat it as I didn't want it to take any longer and disjoint our meal more. The food was nice but not worth the £12 per main or the hype surrounding this restaurant. Overall we were upset by the attitude of service we received as we were made to feel unwelcome from the start entering the restaurant. Very sorry to have to write a negative review."
,,
Delicious... only one little qualm!,Date of visit: September 2017,"Food was delicious to Mildred's standards, cocktail was absolutely divine and passion fruit tartlet may as well have been paradise. However I was charged about 25% service charge on my meal... not sure why? Hate to be pernickety and paid it anyway but it did put a little dampener on an otherwise faultless evening!"
Terrible Service,Date of visit: September 2017,The food might be nice but the wait for a table and then the service throughout your meal is just terrible. I am just paying for my meal having been here now for 3 hours!! It was supposed to be a quick meal but they just take so long to take your order and do anything. There is also no concept of service with a smile. The food is not worth losing another evening to this place.
Delicious veggie meal,Date of visit: August 2017,I've have visited Mildred's a couple of time before and the food and cocktails have always been amazing. The thing that lets it down is its popularity. Once you are able to get a seat the tables are very tightly compact so you end up invaded other peoples space. Also you feel rushed to finish as the crowd of people wait for a table by the bar. Fighting through the crowd to get out does spoil the evening.
Late Lunch,>,"Mildred’s is a well established restaurant in Soho, and has been there for almost 30 years. It is a vegetarian/vegan restaurant with a wide selection of cuisine from all over the globe, including Japanese, Mexican and European. My daughter and I visited on Monday, around 14:00 and the place was extremely busy. Fortunately, we were seated immediately. The tables are very tightly packed in and there is very little room to move, but the atmosphere was great. The staff were very busy, but also very efficient. We decided on a few small plates which consisted of; gyoza dumplings with sweet chilli and soya dip £6.00 (so pleased we ordered two plates of gyozas as they tasted amazing); chargrilled roman style artichoke crostini with lemon aioli £7.00 (very tasty), and the roasted miso aubergine with ginger and spring onions £4.00 (we enjoyed this, however, a little disappointed the ginger flavour did not come through. This is definitely crammed dining, which you must be prepared for, but we loved the menu, which is particularly great for vegans. We will definitely be back."
Very good food in great location,Date of visit: September 2017,"Dishes are tasty and everything is good here. Crowded and nicely decorated, the rooms are lovely. The waiter was friendly and efficient. I can't wait to come back here."
Mildreds (Dalston Junction) - Great vegan experience!,Date of visit: September 2017,"Few days ago my boyfriend and I decided to try this vegetarian restaurant in Dalston Junction. When we walked in we were quite impressed by the size of the venue, spacious with a clean and modern look. As we made ourselves comfortable the manager explained us the menu and gave us some recommendations on what to try. Since we are both vegans we discovered with enormous pleasure that the menu offers many vegan options to choose from. I went for a superb lentil and tofu burger accompanied by sweet potato fries to dip on a delicious vegan mayo while my bf ordered Mock duck (made of seitan) served with noodles. Both of us were really happy about our mains so we decided to try some of the desserts too. We tried the pannacotta made of coconut milk served with lime and lychee and the merengue (made of aquafaba) and ice cream with passion fruit sauce. I really don't know what I liked more as I had never tried those desserts before. Without any doubt I had the best vegan dessert experience of my life and I can't wait to go back to try more goodness! 10/10"
Absolutely delicious!,Date of visit: September 2017,"We had the mushroom and ale pie a long with the pizette and chips! 100% recommend oh and don't forget your pineapple, apple and strawberry juice!!"
Good vegan food,Date of visit: August 2017,"Come here fairly often (working nearby) - it's always busy, sometimes you have to wait, but the food is always good, fairly priced (not cheap but it's London), and the staff are friendly. It's not life changing but I keep coming back as I know what I'll get and I like the food."
Great veggie food and a buzzing atmosphere,>  >  >  >,"This is a small narrow restaurant and thus gets very busy. There is no booking system so you have to turn up and await your turn. This is made very bearable by the fine range of cocktails available! The food is tasty, plentiful and fresh. There are some lovely desserts and a reasonable wine list. The service was good and friendly. Prices are on the high side but it is in Central London."
A Soho institution!,Date of visit: September 2017,"Mildred's has been a solid presence in Soho for nearly 30 years now - championing vegetarian food when it used to be rare for a restaurant to do so. I've visited twice in recent weeks, and have been pleased to find it's still doing a great job offering a wide selection of solid dishes, drawing on the best of global cuisine for inspiration - Thai, chinese, Japanese, Mexican and European. There's no booking system, so if you go at the height of dinner time from Weds-Sat you can expect to queue for up to an hour. But they have a nice cocktail bar area, so for us it was no hardship to sip on a blackberry breeze and aperol spritz and chat while we waited! This is a busy place, there is a lot of table sharing so if you're looking for privacy it's not the place to go, but if you're looking for a friendly atmosphere it's great. , Food is coming out of the kitchen on a continuous basis, and service is brisk and efficient without being unfriendly, waiters have little time to linger and chat, but were very pleasant. Our shared gyoza starter was very moreish. The tofu burger was smokey with well cooked sweet potato chips. I was a little disappointed when my mushroom and ale pie dish was not very hot, and sent it back, but there was little fuss and the replacement dish was fine. All in all the food was well seasoned, flavoursome, with decent sized portions.Overall, a pleasant if slightly hectic experience, and a satisfying meal."
,,
Long wait and average food,Date of visit: September 2017,"I came here for the first time with my boyfriend, having read amazing reviews online and we were super excited to give Mildred's a go. Having waited over an hour for a table, we were seated and told they had already run out of several dishes, which was disappointing. We chose the mushroom pie and Mexican bean dish, both of which were pretty average. The ""pie"" was soggy, and more like a turnover, and the Mexican beans were just a selection of quite mushy foods in piles on a plate. Yes, they were tasty, however I don't think it was worth the wait, or the price. We chose not to have dessert, so cannot comment on this.The most redeeming factor was the waitress -- she was very friendly and jolly, cracking jokes even though she was completely rushed off her feet. I don't think we'll come back -- it's a very over-hyped restaurant serving food you can most easily make at home for a third of the cost, or find at any other restaurant without waiting for an hour in a crowded entrance way."
"Great night, thank you.",Date of visit: September 2017,"Had a great night here. Lovely cocktails, food and service. I did drink too much, so watch those cocktails."
Varied veggie,Date of visit: September 2017,"Awesome menu with plenty of vegan and gluten-free options. I had a brown rice bowl with stir fried vegetables and tofu. It was very tasty, but could have used more tofu and the broccoli was slightly undercooked. Overall, I would definitely visit again."
Great food let down by poor service.,Date of visit: September 2017,"I've been a vegetarian for over 25 years but never been to Mildred's despite knowing about it for a long time. So with meat-eating partner and two recently converted to vegetarianism teens we decided to give it a go. There are four branches of Mildred's and we chose Lexington St as we were shopping in the area. There is no table booking system so you just have to pitch up and see what happens. We arrived about 15:30 and got a table straight away but there were plenty of diners still there and the place was pretty busy. On entry the staff weren't particularly friendly and on asking if they had a table were were told to wait further into the restaurant ""on the left"". Someone then wandered off ahead of us with some menus so we followed and sat where they placed the menus but there was no interaction from the staff. There was some food on my chair and some on the floor also.The person taking our order appeared to have no interpersonal skills and he barely spoke to us or give any eye contact.he looked bored.The food itself was very good and some of the best vegetarian food I have had; both of my children agreed as did my meat eating partner. Some bread and olives, two starters, 4 mains, one pudding and some alcoholic drinks came to £113 including £12 service. Not bad for central London. Shame about the miserable staff."
So so veggie,Date of visit: August 2017,"At last we are at a point where at least some people realise that a vegetarian meal is not necessarily a penance or a moralistic ideal; it is in fact more versatile and just as delicious as a meat based meal. So a restaurant that is entirely vegetarian should be a celebration of this. Not this one. I've been looking forward to trying Mildred's for quite some time now, but never had the stamina or the time to stand in the queue. Is there a strange British tendency to believe that if you have to stand in line for something, it means it is worth waiting for? The atmosphere was buzzing, and fortunately we were given a table upstairs in a smaller room, sharing a large table, which meant that we could hear each other. The service was efficient although, as the waiters were clearly very busy, there was no time for any convivialities. The starters were very good: Egyptian spiced spinach and raisins, miso roast aubergine and artichoke crostini were all tasty and a bit different. But the menu for the main courses was a little uninspiring and quite dull considering the variety of vegetarian dishes one finds on current menus in restaurants not boasting vegetarianism. That's not to say that the food was bad at all, just not very special. If you are vegetarian and want to visit a restaurant which offers you several choices of dishes, this is worth a visit, but it is no beacon for vegetarian food."
Good Vegetarian restaurant,Date of visit: August 2017,Firstly I am not a vegetarian and it used to be that choosing a veggie restaurant would be a big fat no however my views are changing due to places like Mildreds. This is a good restaurant with great tasting food. It's extremely busy which says a lot. The atmosphere is bustling too which I like but that may not be everyone's taste. We will definitely be trying more on the menu the next time we visit London. Don't discount this place as it's wonderful.
food not good enough to vindicate an hour's wait in the street,Date of visit: August 2017,"the food was top draw euro-veg (i.e. most south Indian vegetarian restaurants are better) but a HUGE step forward for people who don't like curries or want to eat posh..service was fast, efficient and pleasant, drinks good and not too expensive, crowded, a little noisy but altogether great once you were there at a table.but we had to wait over an hour and you cant go away as they may give your table away!so daft, never again."
Friendly service and a great dinner on a busy Friday night,Date of visit: August 2017,"For a fairly small place, Mildred's was managed impeccably when my partner and I visited for dinner. We were put on a waiting list on arrival as it was full but could still order drinks from the bar. Once sat around 10mins later we were not rushed in the slightest to order our food and received very attentive service. No complaints at all, overall a wonderful evening of food; some breads/oils, temderstam broccoli, gyoza dumplings, followed by a burger with sweet potato wedges (delicious!) and a mushroom and ale pie.. needless to say we didn't have room for any dessert! I would highly recommend a visit to this vegan haven, seemed a much better experience than another mildred's I have been to near kings cross!"
Great restaurant,>  >  >,"Mildreds has really good vegan food, we tried the quinoa salad with avocado, and the vegan burger with sweet potato fries, then we tried the vegan brownie with salted caramel sauce which was really lovely!"
Vegan Haven in London,>,"I just ate here tonight with my husband and two of our non-vegan friends and we were all pleasantly surprised with our meals. The service, presentation and most importantly the taste of the food were all excellent and reasonably priced as well. There was a bit of a line after 630pm so best to come at around 6pm."
,,
Cold food,Date of visit: August 2017,"Went to Mildred's last weekend for the first time and was quite disappointed. We waited for 40 minutes in the que, which is fine when you get a great meal, however it was not. They leave the food on a shelf in the restaurant (not under a heater) and with the door open. I could see our food sitting there ready as there was only two of us and they let it sit there for five minutes before bringing it over. Both my mushy peas and chips were cold, luckily the pie was still hot inside. I was waiting for someone to come over and ask how it was, nobody approached us at all. Leaving food on my plate, I expected them to ask when bringing the bill, still nothing.. poor customer service and a cold disappointing meal"
"Excellent Vegan Meal, Great value.",Date of visit: August 2017,"My wife and I ate at Mildred's twice during our recent visit to London. We are both long time Vegans, and always looking for great Vegan meals while traveling. Mildred's was a great find. The dumplings are to die for. They are just amazing. We both got the Classic Burger and it was a huge portion. The second time we shared one, along with the dumplings and were more than satisfied. The first time we were just off the plane and needed a bit more food. Overall the vibe is great, and the food is great, as well as the service. During our second visit I found a tiny gnat in my water glass. Nothing to do with cleanliness, and not really an issue, I just didn't want to drink it. The server immediately removed the glass when I pointed it out and without even asking removed the 12.5% service charge from our bill. I didn't expect that and was appreciative of the gesture. Overall a great experience. Be aware that around meal times the restaurant is very busy and you might have to wait a bit. It is well worth it."
i love Mildreds,Date of visit: August 2017,"Mildreds serves great food in an a lovely atmosphere. It's a must for healthy food lovers.My fav location is the one in Soho and the 'stir fried vegetables, broccoli, baby corn, peppers and chilli in sweet soy with peanuts, organic tofu, brown jasmine rice and kimchi' is a must!"
What's the fuss?,>  >  >  >,"Really didn't understand the hype... we went on a Thursday night and the restaurant was buzzing. Got a ticket at 7pm and was advised the wait time was going to be 1.5hrs. Went to a nearby bar/restaurant did drinks/ nibbles and came back at 830pm and waited another half an hour. Food was quite bland and just average. Portion was big and it was cheap but definitely not worth the 2 hrs wait and the lack of services. TBH, We would rather have eaten at the place where we waited! The highlight for us was the brownie (so much for trying to be healthy at a vegan/vego restaurant)"
Loved it,Date of visit: August 2017,Amazing food and an amazing service. Highly recommend! Fresh cooked tasty meal. My sweet potato curry fabulous as always! Will be back soon.
food a bit too weird for me,Date of visit: April 2017,"In the 1990's Mildred's in Soho was one of my absolute favourite places to eat. Since then I've lived away from London, and when back have never had an opportunity to seek it out. Recently I did so when in town with my daughter, excited to share something with many happy memories. Sadly, it was a real disappointment. I love vegetarian food, but this was all a bit too weird for both of us and the flavours were interesting rather than delicious. It was also crushingly busy and the back seated area was really poky with little natural light. My choice came with three salads, which I had expected to be able to choose from the selection appetisingly shown in the front window, but instead they were chosen for me - and were not what I would have picked. On the positive side I am sure it was all very healthy."
"poor service, poor food",Date of visit: August 2017,4 of us ate here for a pre-theatre meal.we were seated upstairs. the waitress took our order for food and drinks without writing it down and then tried to remember the order as she keyed it into the ordering screen.She forgot one of the drinks. Hardly surprising.I ordered the mushroom and ale pie. It was served with minted mushy peas and chips (called fries).The food was almost cold and on a cold plate. The pie would have been OK if it had been hot. The mushy peas had a dollop of mint (from a jar?) on top.My companions were unimpressed by their food.There are hundreds of places in central London for pre-theatre food. We won't be visiting this one again.
Delicious veggie food,Date of visit: August 2017,We went to Mildreds following a recommendation and were not disappointed. We did have to queue for about 10 mins to be seated and the restaurant is quite noisy but they were the only negatives. The food selection was varied and I had trouble choosing. I plumped for the Soul Salad Bowl (£12) which was delicious and my sister really enjoyed her halloumi burger (£7). We shared a plate of Egyptian Spiced spinach (£5) which was quite small but very tasty. Water is supplied without having to ask which is always a plus. I would definitely recommend Mildreds and will certainly eat there again.
Best vegan meal I've had,>  >  >,"Went to Mildred's on a Wednesday evening and was pleasantly surprised to see it was absolutely rammed at 6pm! Although we had to wait an hour for a table it was 100% worth the wait. I had the gyoza dumplings, vegan tofu burger and the chocolate brownie. I literally cannot fault ANY of it, everything was so delicious and some of the best vegan food I have tasted. Once we were seated the service was very quick and the staff were also very polite and welcoming. Will definitely be returning when back in London!"
"Good food, crap service",>  >,"When I went to London last month, my friend told me that I absolutely had to go to Mildred's. Unfortunately, the line up was too long so I made it my mission to go this time around! The food is a bit expensive and the service is crap, but the food is really great! But seriously... the service was awful and it wasn't even busy. I felt like I was being rushed out as our server kept collecting our empty dishes without saying a word. We had to ask to get another jar of water and to look at a desserts menu. I would say this place is a tad over-hyped."
,,
5 star food with 3 star service,Date of visit: August 2017,Staff are pretty awful in this place. Very functional and they make you feel like they're doing you a favour. We had to ask to order and walk up and pay as they took so long. Food on the other hand was excellent! I'm not a veggie but had the sweet potatoe green curry and it filled me up before the theatre! My girlfriend is veggie and loved the range on the menu. Atmosphere was cosy and busy.
Nice food poor service.,Date of visit: August 2017,"The food was good and tasty. The service though poor, very poor. Even though the staff was friendly our food came 40 min after placing the order. We were a bit disappointed seeing other people who arrived after us getting their food faster."
Really great atmosphere,Date of visit: August 2017,"Busy, really busy and you can't book!! That said go and wait if you have to. We were a group of seven and had a great time. The food was truly excellent, a vegetarians heaven. We took a meat loving friend who had pretend chicken and chips, he loved it! If I could cook like this at home I'm sure I could convince more people to go veggie."
Amazing food and awesome vibe!,Date of visit: July 2017,"The energy and vibe of Mildreds is awesome, all the tables around us were having an amazing time and the service is great! The food is to die for with gluten free options too! The cocktails are also delicious. Perfect little place for catch up dinners with friends or casual date nights"
Great for a Veggie Treat,Date of visit: July 2017,"I've visited Mildreds before and the cocktails and food quality is good! Although a few tips that could make it more notable. Although Mildreds has a great selection & the front of house was fantastically accommodating a few tips could have made for a more pleasurable experience! Definitely try the host of starters and their mock meats are fantastic too! My partner noted his Sweet Potato Fries arrived cold, which ruined the meal for him and found although the food good quality and delicious a little bland for our spicy tongues!"
Great food,>,We loved the food and the choices were great. Nice to see a good variation. Highly rate the mushroom ale pie. Sweet potato fries a must have. The best treat was the Chocolate brownie with caramel sauce and ice cream. Even a none vegan would absolutely love this dessert.
Be prepared to wait!,Date of visit: July 2017,"This place is very popular so they operate a waiting system at peak times, but it is worth it. Also we had been pre-warned so enjoyed one of their lovely mocktails while we waited (about 40 minutes from 6.30). Friendly staff and a wide menu to cater for all requirements at a reasonable price. I could have done with a bit more spice or savour in the dressing. The fuzzy green balls (!) were a great finisher."
Love this place,Date of visit: July 2017,I've been here 3 times now and an absolutely brilliant place for vegans. Excellent food and very friendly staff. It's quite small and gets very busy during the evening so worth booking a table but having said that I never have and quite happy to sit at the bar for no longer than 20 mins. Definitely worth a visit and not expensive
"Great place for vegans, vegetarians and anyone who looks good food",Date of visit: July 2017,"My son is vegan so I was looking for a decent restaurant that would also be good for my daughter and I, not vegans. We had to wait about half an hour for a table but it was a nice summer evening and we stood outside with a cocktail so it was OK. It has a bustling, young, hip vibe but bearable for oldies like me too. Everything we had was great - I had the halloumi burger with chargrilled aubergine/eggplant. Our waiter was a bit distracted though not enough to ruin the evening. Would definitely recommend for vegans, vegetarians and those who have not yet crossed over."
Great food,Date of visit: July 2017,Great food with a good atmosphere. Located near Piccadilly circus. The prices are reasonable and the service was extremely fast. I enjoyed my Mexican taco bowl. The ingredients were high quality and very fresh. I cant recall the name but they have a very spicy sauce available that is quite a treat for those who enjoy hot food.
,,
Tasty Veggie/Vegan Lunch,Date of visit: July 2017,"Based on recommendation from Rick Steves' Best of England book (and the fact that our son is vegan), we chose to have lunch here rather than dinner due to comments about no reservations/long waits. We went around 2:00pm, so didn't have a wait and were seated immediately. Our server wasn't particularly friendly, but not rude either, so no major complaints. The food was delicious, even for two omnivores, and it was wonderful to find somewhere that could also be a treat for our son."
Excellent veggie fare,>,"Recently turned vegetarian, the partner and I enjoyed our visit to this restaurant. We ordered gyoza dumplings, egyptian spinach with raisins and pistachios, and a mexican plate with quinoa, avocado and the works.Food was flavorful, and was spiced appropriately to tickle our Indian palate. Staff was good and we were in and out in 40 minutes.Loved it. Recommend wholeheartedly for nonveg and veg both."
Food was great but very crowded,Date of visit: April 2017,"We went at around 5pm and managed to get a table after only waiting a couple of minutes but the tables are very cramped and it was distracting sitting so close to the couple next to us and hearing all about their lives! I suppose that's the down side of a good restaurant - too many people! Food was very nice, service was good but they were run off their feet and it took a while to get service for extra drinks etc. at times."
A wonderful meal,Date of visit: July 2017,I and my wife had gone to its Soho restaurant on a Monday evening and boy was it bustling with activity. Warm and friendly but they rustle up amazing vegan preparations. A go to place while visiting London.
Gorgeous,>  >,"A beautiful light airy restaurant with friendly warm service.We visited on a Tuesday afternoon and we were seated immediately.Water was served straight away which was a lovely touch - you never get that in restaurants, never mind in London! I ordered a classic burger and chips and my partner had the pie - we both thoroughly enjoyed them, they were delicious. It's probably the best vegetarian burger I've ever eaten!For dessert we shared polenta and that was also gorgeous.Would definitely return here, highly recommended."
Special celebratory dinner,>,"Ordinarily we're not fans of no-reservation restaurants but Mildred (soho) is bustling that even at 7:30 on a Saturday night after the Pride March we only waited 30 minutes for a table. We were given a tab number so we could order from the bar while we waited. So we ordered hibiscus sours cocktails which were finished with edible flowers. We drank these sitting outside soaking in the atmosphere. When we were seated we ordered the Tokyo Bowl and the Sri Lankan butternut squash curry. Both meals were exquisite. The curry in particular was well thought through, including the fresh zingy coconut sambal that accompanied it. The portions were generous also. We washed this down with an organic crisp white Finca Enguera from Valencia. We managed to leave room for pudding (just) and shared an ice cream served with a side if pomegranate and chocolate sauce - which was rich, bitter, citrusy and sweet at the same time."
Lives up to the hype,Date of visit: July 2017,"Mildreds was at the top of my list for places to eat during my recent visit to London, and it did not disappoint. I'd heard about the restaurant's popularity, so my friend and I got there around 5 and a good chunk of the tables were already occupied. We were able to get seated right away, but if we'd come any later, we would have had to wait. And when I got my meal, I would say the reputation of the restaurant and the lines are completely justified. The halloumi sandwich was insanely good (the combination of the cheese, eggplant, and harissa, yum!) and my friend's Mexican bowl looked just as delicious. They also make a mean Aperol spritz. Highly recommend."
My go to vegan restaurant,Date of visit: February 2017,"This is my absolute favourite vegan restaurant to take friends and family too. You don't need to be even veggie to enjoy the veggie/vegan menu - the recipes are superb and so flavourful, everyone I've taken there has been really impressed to find you can actually enjoy vegan food! The service is always really friendly and laid back and I always have a great time there. It's a cosy little place with an intimate feel. You do have to wait at the bar for a table to become available, but the wait never feels frustrating/intense and the staff always have the waiting list under control."
Delicious food as always,Date of visit: July 2017,"I brought my 84-year-old Mum here last Saturday night to celebrate her birthday. We'd come here years ago when it was in its old location. This one feels very narrow but there's just enough room in the dining area. The lady allocating seating was very switched on and managed our expectations almost to the minute. The G&T was good while we waited, and the wine and food were more than worth it. Considering how busy they were, service was excellent. Can't wait to go back!"
Delicious food!,Date of visit: June 2017,"This restaurant is a bit cosy as it lacks in space, however, it makes up for it with the delicous and healthy vegan and vegetarian food and the great atmosphere! I have been to Mildred's at least a dozen times and it never fails to amaze with its delicious flavours! It is a must when visiting London or livivng here and looking for a new favorite spot!"

Long wait but worth it,Date of visit: May 2017,Totally vegetarian food in central London. As usual jostling for seats as everyone pours out of work. Warm eve so we queued outside with a bottle of sparkly. We eventually were seated at the bar and then had a fab meal with dessert. Bit rustic if you like that sort of thing. Crammed packed and busy. Good food.
Vegan experience,Date of visit: June 2017,Had to queue and the venue is very small. We shared a table otherwise the wait would of been even longer. Food was delicious and arrived quickly to say how busy they were. Our waitress was terrific with a great sense of humour. The only downfall was the noise from everyone trying to outdo each other so my sister and I spent lunch getting a lecture from the couple we were sharing the table with on Christian Ministeries. As great as the food was I would pick a time when it is less crowded if you want to have a conversation without shouting.
A Gem of the main track,Date of visit: June 2017,"My wife and i went here for our anniversary. We had to google it to find it as its not obvious, but we turned up at 2:20 pm and had to wait 20 mins its sooo popular. But my god it was worth the wait we had starter, main and cocktails and it was all terrific. Would not normally have cocktails but nice for a special day otherwise have the free water. we have nothing bad to say and will be returning next time we are in the area. i suggest you find this place mains approx 12pds worth the money"
Nice cafe with good food,>,Loved the vibe at Mildred's a very happy place buzzing with conversations. Food was nice though not exceptional there were lots of options for vegans and vegetarians. Personally I'd go back again for the service! Food is always better with happy staff with a sense of good humour :)
Used to be so good...,Date of visit: June 2017,"I have always loved Mildreds. I have been here regularly over many years and the food was always exceptional. So the fact that you have to wait for a table and the place is often noisy and crowded can be forgiven due to the quality of the food. However, this is no longer the case. The menu appears to have dramatically changed and is now incredibly dull. The option I ordered read like it was an interesting nacho/Mexican dish but it ended up being a few individual portions of vegetables on a plate with some raw pineapple in the middle. No corn chips in sight! Most of the other menu options were either salads or stir fry options. They also appear to have got rid of their Starter Menu in place of a Small Plates Menu, which was basically made up of side dishes.They were also so keen to get us out the door once we had finished the meal, that the waiter practically took the plate before I had even placed my fork down after the last mouthful.Such a shame."
Mildred without George,>,"Well what can I say? A good menu, great food, friendly efficient staff. A good vibe, well priced and a Fig Martini to due for. You must go. Negatives, only two, you can't book, but go early and it's not a problem and the plates were small. The portion large but small plates made for interesting food juggling."
Really nice vegi/vegan restaurant,Date of visit: June 2017,"Went with a vegan colleague on a work overnight. I was really impressed, I'm not usually a massive vegetarian fan but enjoyed everything. Had some hummus and bread to start, Mexican plate then rhubarb cheesecake to finish which was delicious. Would happily recommend."
Spot on,Date of visit: June 2017,I'm a vegan and visited mildreds with my omni friend and we both loved there so much! I ordered the tofu burger she tried the halloumi one and we had a couple of cocktails aswell. The food was delicious and filling and the cocktails were great too. The staff were friendly and attentiveKeep up the good work Mildred!
Great for vegans,>,"My boyfriend took me here for a birthday lunch as a surprise. Really cool place. Vegan items on the menu were all very clearly labelled and there were plenty. For starters we had the grilled artichokes with toasted bread and it was one of the best things i've ever eaten honestly. He then ordered the stir fry for his main, which was amazing. I got the ceasar salad because I wanted to see how they'd veganise it but was kind of disappointed as it came made with ice berg lettuce instead of romaine. The dressing was a bit watered down and weak as well. I should have said something but all the staff looked really busy as the place was packed and I was starving, so I didn't. Everything else definitely made up for it though and I would come back again."
One of the best vegetarian burgers I have ever had! Vegetarian for 20 years!,Date of visit: June 2017,We went there on a Friday afternoon for lunch. I had the classic smoked tofu burger with Monterrey Jack cheese and sweet potato fries . . . Awesome!! Great staff & service too!
,,
Never lets me down,Date of visit: June 2017,I've been here 5 times and never been disappointed. Went on a Friday evening and was told that the wait would be 30 minutes. Actually was only 10 minutes. Great meal and great value. They do a great job combining interesting flavours on the plate.
Delicious,Date of visit: May 2017,"Very popular but luckily we visited at a quiet time, lovely bright airy but small place. Service prompt and friendly. Food absolutely delicious! Looking forward to visiting the other branches."
AVOID AT ALL COSTS,Date of visit: June 2017,"Having been told we would have a 40 minute wait, we were concerned that the wait ended up being 1 hour 30 minutes, with no information from the lady running the tables. When asked very politely what the current situation was, she told us she would not seat us until we had the fourth member of our party arrive (having not advised of this before spending £25 at the bar.) When we protested that this information would have impacted our decision to eat there had we been advised before she argued that we'd ""only bought 3 drinks in an hour"" insinuating we should have spent more on their overpriced drinks. She was unnecessarily aggressive and disrespectful. I recommend the tapas two minutes away. They were so lovely and salvaged an otherwise disappointing evening."
Vegetarian restaurant,>  >  >  >,"Hade a wonderful late lunch at Mildred's in soho. Purely vegetarian and what a fantastic choice of food. You can't book so our late lunch was a good idea. Food was superb and service was excellent, will definitely return when next in London."
Found on internet while on train! What a choice!,Date of visit: June 2017,"My friend and I were going to a show in London and had time to look for a restaurant for lunch. Found Mildreds in Soho on Trip Advisor and decided to give it a try. Wow! Busy but staff really keeping up with the trade. First big tick, bottle of water and two glasses put on table as soon as we sat down. I get so cross in the UK that I have to ask for water. Amazing range of nationalities, staff were friendly, attentive and polite even though they were so busy. Plenty of vegetarian and vegan options . Also a note to explain what might be in each dish like, gluten, nuts, soya, eggs etc. Good price for centre of London for such a good lunch. Main dish, juice ( great juices) , dessert and coffee ( with a choice of soya milk) . The sweet potato fries with basil mayo were so yummy. £25 each. I will definitely go back."
Expected better,Date of visit: June 2017,"As my train was delayed I looked for a vegetarian restaurant close to kings cross and this appeared to be the top rated and within a 5 minute walk from the station. It was 5pm and I was surprised to find how empty it was but pleased at the same time that I had no problem getting a table. Quite a few choices of vegan and vegetarian meals on the menu and as I had read reviews about the wild mushroom pie I decided to give that a go. I ordered a vegan bottle of pale ale to enjoy whilst my food was being cooked but surprisingly they both came within a minute of each other. This suggested to me that the food was already cooked and on standby. Don't get me wrong, the pie filling was very tasty but having oven chips with it and a small portion of mushy peas didn't leave me feeling like I had an outstanding home cooked vegan meal. Overall I was in and out in little over 15 minutes."
Delicious Vegetarian Meal,Date of visit: May 2017,Enjoyed a delicious dinner at Mildreds and even the non-vegetarian in our party enjoyed the meatless fare. Lots of vegan options. Good selection of wine too.It's a very popular restaurant ~ we lucked out and got a table upstairs right away (it was 7:30pm on a Bank Holiday) but waiting for a table is more the norm.
The Juiciest Veggie Burger I Ever Had,Date of visit: June 2017,"Having grown up in the Netherlands, I've gotten used to dry veggieburgers, so I hadn't eaten a veggieburger in a while. But, I though I should try a burger at Mildred's because it sounded so delicious on the menu card. I am so happy that I chose for the Polish burger! It was so deliciously big and juicy. And the monterey jack cheese just made it that much better. The English obviously way higher standards than the Dutch when it comes to veggieburgers. The strawberry daiquiri is also a must try for the fellow alcoholics out there. The place itself is quite small, so you have to be prepared to wait for a table as it is very popular, but the people are very friendly and the service is fast."
"Awesome, amazing, fantastic veggie food",Date of visit: May 2017,"Amazing veggie food in the heart of Soho. Best veggie burger and amazing sweet potato fries. The dips are incredible. Only thing is, it gets very busy so either arrive before the crowds (before 1pm at lunch) or be prepared to wait. Nice selection of beers too."
Great Experience and Food,Date of visit: May 2017,We eat at 2 of Mildred's locations. Soho location was small and very busy with a very trendy crowd. Kings Cross was much larger with a younger local crowd. The menus was similar at both with excellent Vegan dishes. The Curry and burger were outstanding. Also try the hummus for appetizer...really good.
,,
Amazing food and juice.,Date of visit: January 2017,Just wonderful veggie food. Would eat here every night if I could. The juices were amazing too. I even bought the cook book!
DONT GO HERE FOR A QUIET CONVERSATION!,Date of visit: May 2017,"Took my Vegan daughter here for dinner. Yes there's no reservations (you will get over the standing in the doorway routine, a bit like queuing for school dinners) and we were given a number and told it would be about an hour. Plenty of nearby bars and tapas joints to while away the time and after a very nice manzanilla and some olives next door we were called in after 35 mins.What a buzz, the place was rammed with noisy, exuberant youngsters (ok so I'm old but I still love the sheer vitality of a restaurant where you can barely hear your dinner partner across the table!)And the food, yes the food. Its either Vegan or Veggie but if you think Middle Eastern or Oriental/South Indian that labelling is irrelevant.And yes its good, very good and beware the portions are large. Let me only mention the vegan Cappuccino Panna-Cotta which I would never have believed wasn't dairy and finally the price £65 for 3 courses for 2 (Dinner in London?)If I could eat like this regularly I would certainly be tempted away from the ""Dark Side""."
Very delicious,Date of visit: May 2017,"Very nice and warm place. The restaurant is vegetarian, but you can find lots of vegan dishes. Very nice"
Porn Stars Rock!,Date of visit: December 2016,"Fantastic place to eat vegan food and mingle. The tables are really close, makes you feel like you are at one big dinner table. LOVED it! The first time I had ever had a Porn Star Cocktail was here and I LOVED IT! Food 10/10; Drinks 10/10; Staff 10/10; Atmosphere 10/10. Definitely visit this awesome place. We have been a few times now and never disappointed."
Late Veggie Lunch,>  >,First time visit for reviewer as recommended by family guest as a birthday treat.Very busy as it was Bank Holiday Monday so expected the 45 mins wait as informed when we were logged in on our arrival.Mildreds in Soho is smaller than expected and I left hoarse after trying to speak to my Cousin above the voices of the other patrons but enjoyed the buzz of the place.Our table was situated at back under the skylight so it felt airy and not as dark as the entrance of Mildreds.My meal was Mushroom Pie with mushy peas and sweet potato chips which was yum yummy and most delicious. My Cousin enjoyed the Halloumi Burger tho it was a bit spicy and we shared the sweet potatoes.Our Waitress Anjelica was most helpful and we had lots of the water with our meal.Well worth the price and only let down by the loos situated downstairs and only one each for guys and girls in the same room which is quite continental and possibly cos space is tight so be aware. Though nice lotions.Would like to try another Mildreds to compare.All in all a fun experience and one for people watching.
Good but not great...,Date of visit: May 2017,"Expected the wait (30 minutes) but if had I known that I would have to share a table with strangers I think I would have gone else where, it was cramped & uncomfortable for all parties and made the whole experience less enjoyable. Food was good, but having visited a couple of years ago many dishes were the same. Service wasn't great despite there being several staff. Chocolate brownie however.... Amazing!"
Great option for vegetarians!!,>  >,"We had dinner at Mildreds on Easter weekend 2017. We are vegetarians and Mildreds is a vegetarian / vegan option in Soho. It was busy even at 7 pm in the evening and we had to wait for 30 min before we got a table. We had a sweet potato dish with rice and hummous with bread. The food was awesome, just perfect in terms of taste, presentation and spice. The servers though could have a smile on their face but maybe they were overworked."
Great vegan delight,Date of visit: May 2017,"Tried this place based on other reviews, so glad we made the choice.... Fun vibrant surroundings, great staff, delicious food and a good menu to choose from. We are recent converts to vegan eating, and this place proves its a good decision. Our meal was tasty, and everyone around us looked like they all had delicious food infront of them. The desserts were also to die for!We will return, just to try something else off the menu!Good value too."
Amazing,Date of visit: May 2017,Even if you're not vegetarian you have to try it. The gluten free beer was very good and every dishes was amazing.
Fantastic lunch :),Date of visit: May 2017,"We went around 1pm on Monday - very busy and had to wait in a queue for a table for two. Despite being hugely busy the service was quick and friendly. Had the wrong drink given at the beginning but this was quickly rectified when I brought it to the waiter's attention. All vegetarian but a lot of vegan options on the menu. We had a starter, main and dessert and all were delicious. I had a tofu burger with vegan cheese which was a monster and very tasty. Overall we were very pleased with the food and attentive service. Reasonably priced."
,,
"overpriced, rude staff",Date of visit: May 2017,overpriced and when i complained about the quality of my meal i received a very unprofessional response from the management. life is too short there are much better places to eat
Amazing lunch,Date of visit: May 2017,"Absolutely loved this place! Food was amazing and very quick and friendly service... I had humous and flatbread starter. Loads of humous definitely a generous portion size and it tasted lovely with the flatbread, we also had a starter of roasted aubergine which was very tasty. Both of us had burgers, I had the haloumi burger I believe that came with aubergine, although I may be wrong... whatever was in it, it was delicious! Sweet potato chips with the main were also fantastic... the crumble pudding we had was very nice, wonderful flavours. Would definitely dine here again if in the area... thoroughly recommend"
Beyond expectation for food!,Date of visit: May 2017,"Team worked really hard considering the huge line of customers waiting for tables, really great staff with top reccommendations. Food was unbelievably good.. seamless catering for gluten free and vegan. Can't wait to return to try out more of the menu! Tip for future customers, wait in the queue - it's worth it"
Amazing vegetarian food,Date of visit: January 2017,"This place really does have talented chefs. Try the Sri Lankan curry...it is absolutely delicious! I often come here after work with friends as it is central with a great atmosphere, but those positives mean that you are likely to wait up to an hour for a table, with little room in the bar area. It's not a place for a leisurely meal and you can feel slightly rushed, however I keep returning as the food is worth it. :)"
Stick To Your Ribs Vegan Food,Date of visit: May 2017,"We were fortunate to only have a five minute wait for a table at lunch. I went for the Wood Roasted Mushroom and Ale Pie. The Mushy Peas were the surprise, never had them before and they are great! Husband loved the Sri Lankan Sweet Potato and Green Bean Curry."
A vegan's dream,Date of visit: May 2017,"I've only been plant based for a few months and have to admit to finding going out to eat pretty tough. Mildred's takes the pain away, with great service, lovely food and a fabulous vibe! I can't recommend highly enough."
"Delicious, well presented and satisfying!",Date of visit: May 2017,Visited for a pre-theatre meal and aware of the no booking policy arrived at 6pm before it became too busy. We were fortunate and there was a table available straight away. The restaurant is long and narrow and functional rather than decorative. The waiting staff were efficient and friendly. Service was good and the food arrived promptly which was delicoious and well presented. This was my first visit but my wife had been to Mildreds @ Kings Cross a few months before and was surprised that the menu had not changed. However it is certainly somewhere we will be returning to.
"great atmosphere, great staff and great value for money",Date of visit: April 2017,"I have never had a bad meal here and the staff are always friendly and the service is great. All my meat eating friends have also enjoyed themselves here and I shall keep eating here, thank you :)"
What a business,Date of visit: May 2017,"Went for a pre theatre meal last week.One can not book at this restaurant so we arrived at 5pm and there were only 2 available tables By ,the time we left there was quite a queue outside. The place is very exuberant and noisy.Greetings and staff were very friendly.The menu was extensive and numerous gluten free items were clearly marked.We were totally spoilt for choice.My partner had a phenomenal salad with quinoa and I ordered an equally delicious curry.Both were filling and satisfying.Be warned the rhubarb and ginger cheesecake is to die for.The best ever.Do not miss It! Next time in London we will revisit."
Fabulous vegetarian food!,Date of visit: April 2017,This place is clearly very popular -- and deservedly so! Excellent food and a passionate waiter; the staff clearly shares values of plant-based food. We were seated in the upstairs dining room which was decorated with some saucy Victorian art. Very close to West End.
,,
Creative vegan delights!,Date of visit: May 2017,"Mildred's is great for vegetarian and vegan diners. The food is so tasty and very filling. I would recommend the curry, absolutely delicious. The staff are friendly and hospitable. It can be really busy in the evening, but you can always have a cocktail while you wait!"
Brisk service and disappointing food,Date of visit: April 2017,"The restaurant was busy as expected so my friend and I were more than happy to wait considering the positive reviews we'd heard. We were squished into a cramped waiting area by the door by a waiter who gave us no indication of how long we would be waiting and rudely laughed at our mistake in thinking we could leave a phone number and return. My friend is vegetarian and I'm a meat eater trying to be more veggie so I was very open minded with all the options. I chose the classic burger which was horribly dry and not helped by the dense, cloying ciabatta bun - an elderly lady at the table next door and I were both forced to dissect the burger with knife and fork in order to eat it. The sweet potato fries were fantastic to the extent they almost redeemed the whole meal. The other positive is that you get a very filling meal for the money you pay and the atmosphere is pleasantly relaxed but lively. I really feel for vegetarians if all their burgers taste like this but I'm sure Mildred's is just a bad example. If you end up going, avoid the burgers and pick an alternative like the Sri Lankan curry (which really wasn't Sri Lankan but still tasted nice)"
Dinner with cousin,>  >  >  >,My cousin is a vegetarian and this is his favorite restaurant. We went there twice during my holiday vacation and the food is delicious. The place is always crowded and if you want to avoid waiting you must reach by 6pm or else you might need to wait for an hour or more.
We keep coming back...,>  >  >  >,"I've reviewed before, so I'll keep this short and sharp. Service: excellentFood: excellentValue: very goodWe'll be back"
Vegetarian paradise!,Date of visit: March 2017,I am a vegetarian so its always nice to find a restaurant where you can eat everything off the menu! There is so much choice at Mildreds and the food always higlights how vegetarian food can be so interesting and delicious. A favourite for me and any meat lovers too!
Lovely restaurant.. great staff,Date of visit: May 2017,Popped in for dinner pre Ronnie Scott's.. super friendly and attentive staff. Bellinis and haloumi burger.. tasty food .. very clean loos- will be back ..Thanks
Neighbourhood Gem,Date of visit: April 2017,"Awesome restaurant. Food was the best, Mexican black beans has to be the go to dish. I don't like queuing to get into a restaurant that doesn't take bookings but it was totally worth it in this case. Only a few tables but quite noisy which was the only downside. Cocktails are great too. Highly recommended."
Busy but absolutely worth waiting,Date of visit: May 2017,"My girlfriend and I were in London for a weekend and I wanted to treat her to a nice meal where for once she had plenty of choice (she's vegan). It's safe to say Mildred's didn't disappoint.There's no reservations but I knew that in advance so when it was busy and we had to wait an hour, I was prepared. Handily we could set up a tab and enjoyed a couple of delicious cocktails.Once seated the food was incredible. The halloumi salad was great, the gyoza beautiful. The tofu and stir fried rice was the best vegan meal my girlfriend has ever eaten. My sweet potato curry was yummy, so much so that I bought the book to make it at home! We ordered pudding which was very slow arriving. Staff approached us before we could approach them, and apologised explaining they'd made a mistake and we'd get our crumble at no cost. Excellent customer service right there and something they should be proud of.Loved the food, loved the place, we'll be back"
Best Vegetarian Cuisine,Date of visit: September 2016,"Even if you are not vegetarian, which i am not, this restaurant is amazing.The food is all vegetarian or vegan, with so much choice! My favourites are the Sri Lankan sweet potato curry and the halloumi burger.You will have to get here early, as before it opens there is always a queue."
Delightful vegetarian experience,Date of visit: May 2017,What a wonderful place. The menu was great and it was hard to choose. The range was innovative and used a range of ingredients. The desserts were also excellent. The service was quick efficient and friendly.
,,
Good But No Longer Great,Date of visit: April 2017,"For 15 years we have been making a point of going to Mildreds whenever we are in London as it has always been a highlight of our trip. The food has always been vegetarian, creative, original, flavoursome and, in particular, cooked from the heart.Unfortunately our recent visit reflected the down-side of the growing success of Mildreds from being a boutique restaurant in Lexington Street to now having three locations. The food is still good but no longer has that magical ‘wow’ factor. The market they attract has also changed to appeal to young females and the volume of chatter made it difficult to have a conversation with my wife sitting opposite me on a small table. Mildreds is still good but no longer great, which is sad."
"Gorgeous food, great service.",Date of visit: May 2017,"This place is vegan and veggie heaven. They serve a great selection of snacks, light bites,burgers and main meals. The service is friendly and swift, the food is delicious and nicely presented and the whole place has a relaxed, friendly atmosphere. The only downside is that they don't take bookings so be prepared to queue."
Vegetarian Heaven,Date of visit: February 2017,"Some of the greatest vegetarian and vegan dishes I've had in a very long time I always come back here for comfort food at a great price and amazing flavors! Highly recommended for Lunch, Dinner!!!"
Vegan/Vegetarian Heaven,Date of visit: May 2017,"There is a reason this place is so popular! Awesome menu where everything is or can be made vegan. For those of you who are not vegetarian, give this a chance- the food is creative and really delicious! Only downside is the popularity, actually, as the wait most evenings is about 1-2 hours and they do not take reservations. We managed to cheat the system by arriving around 4 PM for a really late lunch (or early dinner). Don't miss this if you're in London; it was really fantastic (and the only place I could find where we could try vegetarian English pie without eggs)!"
"Fast service, incredible burgers",Date of visit: May 2017,"There was a little wait to get a table, and I can understand why. I ordered the Tofu and lentil burger and my friend ordered the beetroot burger. The food arrived surprisingly fast, which was appreciated as i'd worked up quite the appetite.The focaccia bun was to die for and the burger was very flavoursome with a pleasant texture, the garnishes complimented the burger perfectly. I had a bite of the beetroot burger which was equally delicious, so much so I came back the following day and ordered both burgers again for lunch, resulting in a proud food pregnancy.Please come to Manchester!!"
Wonderful home-cooked vegan food,>  >,"Mildred's is a lovely little place - busy at peak times but we were lucky enough to beat the rush! I had an excellent veggie burger with sweet potato fries, my partner had a delicious vegetable stir fry. I wish we were in London again soon to try the rest of the menu - everything coming out of the kitchen looked fantastic. This would be a good restaurant to take anyone, even carnivores.Staff were pleasant, atmosphere was more comfortable than you'd think considering how many tables are packed in!"
not only amazing food but amazing people attached,Date of visit: April 2017,"I go, quite often. I take away, most thursdays, its enchililada daythe food has always been right up there and consistent, albeit busy.last week instead of the usual two per serving i got back to the office and there was only one, i was a little disappointed, my waist line however was not. so this week i mentioned it and without a bat of an eye, the lady who helped us had offered the misunderstanding on the house - it was unexpected as i blame my laziness in not going straight back and raising it so she took me on my word - am now officially a lifelong client..........service is so simple"
Really positive first impression,Date of visit: April 2017,"Arrived here on Friday around 7pm, there was a queue and we were told that the wait could be at most 45min. We decided to stay and enjoyed excellent cocktails in a really crowded bar. It took about 15min to get a table and the service was good. For starter we shared delicious artichoke with lemon aioli and for main dish I had the classic burger, which was one of the best vegan dishes I've had in a restaurant. The seating was really cramped but overall the atmosphere was nice. Would definitely recommend but choose your arriving time carefully."
Wow! A great experience.,Date of visit: April 2017,"I can't fault Mildred's other than to say the tables were very close together - a drawback of success. Very tasty veggie food, generous portions, very friendly serving staff and a wonderful ambience. One can't book and there was a queue of prospective diners. I started with roasted aubergine, my cousin had smashed avocado. I followed with mushroom and ale pie, substituting salad for the minted peas. She had pasta with asparagus. We both had creme caramel for desert."
Good vegan food,Date of visit: April 2017,"Enjoyed our first vegan meal out. Would recommend the black bean chilli. Bit cramped seating, but nice atmosphere. Would go again."
,,
outstanding food and lovely atmosphere,Date of visit: April 2017,"whether you're a vegetarian or not, the food is very special. Its always very fresh and the ingredients are carefully placed together. The service is always very professional and by far, my no1 place to eat in London. Good value for money too."
50th birthday,Date of visit: April 2017,I booked the upstairs dining room for my birthday. The room was ideal for 12 people and we all had a great time. The service was excellent and everyone loved the food and cocktails.
A favourite haunt that's appeal endures...,>  >,"Mildred's is always packed and the wait for a table can be a pain if you're in a hurry. However when you relax and go with the flow, the time queueing seems to pass more quickly.This venue has a phenomenal buzz to it. As if that wasn't enough...* The food is great* The value is amazing* The team serve you with friendliness and efficiency even when they're flat outWhilst so many restaurants come and go, Mildred's seems to go from strength to strength. Testament to their winning formula :) And I'm definitely no veggie, but I LOVE MILDREDS :)This time I visited with three work colleagues. We ordered drinks, mains and coffees. As always, the food quality was fantastic. The Sri Lankan sweet potato and green bean curry was the standout dish. The wood roasted mushroom and ale pie was also tasty, but did not appeal as much visually as the curry. Our remaining diner, an avowed carnivore, grudgingly went for the burger but even he enjoyed it.As always a thoroughly enjoyable dining experience. Until next time!PS: Gutted that you no longer do my favourite dish at Mildred's. Bring back the Risotto Cakes!!!"
Great food and atmosphere,Date of visit: April 2017,"Early evening was extremely busy, told it would be an hour to wait for a table but in fact was half that, the downside is standing with a drink being crushed and pushed, however, the food was well worth the wait. I am not a vegetarian as is my friend but no problem getting something delicious to eat. Service good and friendly."
Hit and miss menu,Date of visit: April 2017,"After frequenting Mildreds on several occasions, we have learned that you need to choose your meals wisely - it is very hit and miss. On the negative side, you could basically be paying for a very expensive salad. On the plus side, you can get some of the best vegetarian dishes the capital perhaps has to offer!In addition to the pleasant ambience, and more often than not friendly service, Mildreds is somewhere I would recommend you visit. Just avoid the salad dishes."
Very popular and very good,Date of visit: April 2017,"We arrived early evening and it appeared already full. There were a lot of people around the bar. Nevertheless within a few minutes we were taken to a table which we shared with three others. Mildreds had been recommended and having gone on a vegan diet it seemed perfect. The menu was impressive at the pricing system simple (Just the digits).Despite being busy the waitress attended to us quickly. We ordered the halloumi burger some chips and gyoza and I went for the broccoli stir fry with brown rice and tofu.I tasted a chip and it was fantastic. The gyoza was good to but my bowl of stir fry was absolutely gorgeous and filling. A word of warning, take it easy with the hot sauce. It's very hot.I had a beetroot and ginger juice and it was very refreshing. We had a brownie for dessert and that was devoured very quickly.The food was great, the menu exciting, the place is bustling but the staff are great. Highly recommended if you want a healthy meal. It cost just over £40 and we left feeling very happy. There was a queue waiting to get in"
"Busy, bustling,  excellent food",Date of visit: April 2017,"Visited here for early supper, and were lucky to get a table without waiting. Staff were very friendly and attentive, without us feeling rushed. A good choice on the menu and we were all delighted with our choices. Can recommend the halloumi and Thai green curry. Huge queue as we left. Organic wine available too. Can cater for vegans as well as vegetarians. Excellent"
Worth the wait,Date of visit: April 2017,"If you go for Dinner be prepared to wait, there are no reservations. If you want a table for 2 and not a table of 4 shared between 2 couples then be prepared to wait longer and don't get anxsty because a couple who came in after you and here happy to mix it up with strangers get seated first!!!!THE FOOD IS WORTH THE WAIT.Huge plate of mushroom and ale pie with mushy peas and big chunky, crunchy chips. Other half had a Polish burger, which is a beetroot burger. This was also massive with delicious sweet potato fries. Though we were very tempted by the puds being demolished at the tables around us, we were stuffed so had to reluctantly decline.Staff were friendly though obviously very busy.So have a G&T while you wait and chill."
Love this restaurant,>  >,Me and my daughters favourite after visiting London over easter. Delicious vegan food for us and lovely staff!! The service was really good and we just had to go back for lunch the last day.
Amazing place. Dont miss it.,Date of visit: April 2017,"Remember it is a vegeterian! That said, it is amazing. Could ambience, modern place, excellent food. Fully crowded, no reservations. You must go at least with 30 min in advance to get a table and wait. If you want the safe choice order simple things if you are a real foodie then try more complex combinations. I totally recommend this place. Great choice. Price correct for London."

Best Veggie Restaurant in London,Date of visit: March 2017,"Whenever I visit London, Mildreds is always the first place I go for dinner. Although they don't take bookings and you may have to wait a while for a table, it's worth the wait. The food and service are always consistently good. I particularly like their gyozo dumplings and the mushroom and ale pie. It's also great, as a vegan, to have a choice of puddings. I love the place."
Great food!,Date of visit: April 2017,"I've been to Mildred's many times, but I've also been trying out other vegetarian/vegan restaurants. However, I prefer going back to Mildred's. They have a nice menu, good food, the portions are generous and it's in Soho so it's convenient for me! It does get crowded at times, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
Lunch,Date of visit: October 2016,"At the Mildreds the food is excellent. One of the best vegeterian restaurant I ve been. The food is consistent, but the service varies. It is a very busy place, so one may have problems in finding a table at busy times, no matter the day of the week. It is worth a try, but avoid the busy times and near closing time."
Mushroom and ale pie,Date of visit: April 2017,"Absolutely fantastic - if it's on the menu try it, you won't be disappointed! This was a mother day treat, we were seated straight away and service was quick and very friendly. My second visit here and can't wait to go again."
World class vegan eatery AGAIN!!,Date of visit: March 2017,"We went here for lunch, and ended up ordering a second round of main large plates all of us - simply because we had to taste it all.Mildred's - you never disappoint us. You show what can be done with vegetables like no other place I have ever been. From the curry, to the pasta, to the sausages n' mash etc etc.. We are delighted and cant wait for next year when we are back again.Also, this place keeps having the friendliest staff ever. I cant put my finger on a single thing. 5 stars. World class."
Birthday bash,Date of visit: March 2017,"Very busy vegetarian, mainly with a young fashionable crowd though there were a few other crusties here & there. Mildreds doesn't take bookings and you can see why. We arrived at 6.30 & had to wait 50 minutes. Friendly waiting staff. We had a drink in the 'waiting area' along with 8-10 others. Finally got seated at a table for 2 and our waitress was very attentive. I liked my meal but birthday girl was disappointed with hers. More of a wrong choice than a reflection of Mildred's quality. We were joined late on by our 2 adult daughters both of whom ordered cocktails so that the original bill doubled. C'est la vie!"
Vegetarian restaurant,Date of visit: April 2017,I went there for lunch recently with a friend we were both impressed with the food and service. We ordered the vegetarian stir fry and the bean burrito both very filling but had to order desert when we saw someone else order the beetroot and chocolate cake.We also ordered the fruit crumble the food was delicious and will definitely be back for the beetroot and chocolate cake in the near future.
Couldn't wait to visit and can't wait to go again!,>  >  >  >,"A superb vegetarian and vegan restaurant. I don't usually write reviews but after eating at Mildred's I feel have to. From the excellent service to the sublime food I cannot rate this restaurant highly enough. My husband and I popped in at 5pm before the busy period. When we left at 6ish there were queues out the door! If you can get in early, definitely do so to avoid disappointment. That said, the service is so efficient and you can always have a drink in the bar whilst waiting for a table.I ordered the broccoli side, brown rice and steamed dumplings. My husband ordered the BBQ tofu and sweet pot fries. We were both quite full after the mains but when we caught a glimpse of the puds on offer we couldn't resist. We shared the cappuccino brûlée and the vanilla ice cream with warmed salt caramel sauce. Both were delicious. See photos! The staff are really friendly, attentive and efficient.Can't wait to visit next time we are in London. It will be our first stop!"
Great veggie restaurant,Date of visit: April 2017,"All the taste, without the meat. Lovely little restaurant. Tasty food and quick service. Sri Lankan Curry and Black Bean Burrito were both good. It was busy but lots of staff working and food arrived quickly too. Would definitely go back."
Fab veggie restaurant,Date of visit: April 2017,"We ate here for our lunch after searching trip advisor and were not disappointed.We wanted something healthy and with an abundance of restaurants in Soho this is a 'must try'.We had the Sri Lankan sweet potato curry and Black bean & squash burrito with halloumi to start. The restaurant was busy, your tables are close together, but service was very good and you didnt have to wait long for food. They do include a mandatory 10% service charge to your bill but on this occasion we were happy to pay. The food bill was about £45, the balance of the remainder was our drinks bill."
,,
A birthday treat!,Date of visit: April 2017,We lunched in the upstairs private dining room - choosing items off the standard menu. All delicious! Wine choices were very good too and the staff were efficient and charming. A great family occasion.
Great vegetarian food in the city centre,Date of visit: April 2016,"There's always a bit of a waiting time here but the food is worth the wait - vegetarian dishes that even the biggest meat-lover would enjoy. The dining area is a bright and airy space, albeit small, and there's a bar at the front for grabbing a drink while you queue. I've been for dinner twice so far and would definitely go again."
Lots of vegan and veggie options!,Date of visit: March 2017,"Went here with a friend who is vegan having looked up where to eat in London. We arrived here just after 6pm on a Saturday to find we had to wait for some time, this is not a problem but the restaurant is small and as I am mildly claustraphobic it was slightly unnerving for me. However, the wait was not as long as we were initally told and we were seated relatively quickly. The menu is extensive and my friend was extremely happy with it. I have to say there was a lot of choice and the food looked good. The ordering was quick and the food arrived fast.However, the food was flavoured with things that were not on the menu. For example the fries were spicy, not something that was mentioned on the menu and not a problem for us, but this could be for someone else.It is a little pricey (or at least the sides were) but the food was nice and people were having a good time."
Victim of it's own success,Date of visit: March 2017,"Sadly my most recent visit to Mildred's was my most disappointing by far. My friends and I were pleasantly surprised to be seated almost immediately - but this time we were in an upstairs room rather than in the bustling main restaurant. At first this seemed like a nice change but as the room filled up with parties it became apparent that the acoustics were sadly lacking. We could hardly communicate about the noise of excited voices. Our main courses were nice but arrived too quickly to have been cooked freshly and did lack the flavours of previous visits. It is a shame as it is an old favourite, but there are now lots of interesting vegetarian restaurants in London, perhaps Mildred's need to up their game."
Fab,Date of visit: March 2017,"Went for an early dinner before Book of Mormon - early meant no queuing - being veggie usually means having very little to choose from so it was great being spoilt for choice for once! I had 4 of the small plates (hummus, halloumi, dumplings and tofu skewers) and the creme caramel pudding - everything was banging. I nearly threw up everything laughing at Book of Mormon but that was my own fault for being a little piggy :) would love to go back, avoid queuing by eating earlier! Service could have been friendlier and more efficient but food made it all worth it!"
Best vegetarian food in London,Date of visit: February 2017,"Life long veggie - only recently discovered Mildred's and is not a firm family favourite. Amazing food - have visited other sites and always of great quality, have taken passionate meat eaters who couldn't get enough."
Best vegan Restaurant,Date of visit: March 2017,"I have eaten at Mildreds 3 times now and it hasn't been disappointing once. I love that the entire restaurant is Vegetarian/Vegan with so many tasty options to choose from. I'm also a huge fan of the restaurants look and feel - not your typical vegan restaurant that looks like its a work in progress, this one is done out really well.Thank you for bringing this restaurant to London!"
Who needs meat?,Date of visit: March 2017,"Really, who does? I am carnivorous but went completely vegan here and had the most incredible meal! Glad we came at 5pm though as by 5.30 it was very busy with people queuing out of the door!"
Amazing!!,Date of visit: March 2017,"Invited to a friends birthday, being a meat eater, had my reservations. Secretly thinking it was ok as I could get a burger on the way home I was blown away- had the gyozo dumplings and halloumi burger - so delicious as were all the dishes. Mushroom pie was amazing as were the coconut rum shots. Food fantastic, service fantastic, queue out the door, definitely recommend to anyone."
Delicious as ever!,Date of visit: March 2017,Mildred's continues to be my favourite place for veggie food in London. It's generally at least half an hour queuing time on weekdays but food never disappoints!

"If all vegan food was this good, no one would want to eat meat or dairy!",Date of visit: March 2017,"My partner who is vegan, wanted to go out for lunch, so after some googling I discovered Mildred's. We arrived on Saturday around 1pm and despite the place only opening at 12pm, there was already a wait of 20/30 minutes. There's a no booking policy, so due to the popularity of the place there's not much that can be done. However the wait was so worth the while. Once we were seated and given menus (the service was very efficient for the duration of the meal) I couldn't help but notice the food the diners around us were eating and the meals all looked delicious. We both opted for the wood mushroom pie. It was meaty and delicious and had the most intense umami flavour, with the pastry being delightfully flaky. The minted mushy peas were perfect and the chips, thick, crispy and temptingly golden brown. The cocktails were also good and strong and whilst the chocolate and beetroot cake looked a very appetising option, we were far too full to try it. Maybe next time...because we'll definitely be returning!"
"First time visit. Food good, sadly let down by uninterested staff, and paying 12.5% for the pleasure!",Date of visit: March 2017,First time visit recommended by a friend. A little cramped at the back until we moved to a corner seat. food was good and tasty however 2 members of staff didn't seem interested and spent more time looking at themselves in the large mirror behind us as they took the order. really not exactly friendly at all
Wonderful Fresh Vegan Restaurant in Soho!,Date of visit: March 2017,Mildred's was high on our list and we had expectations from researching places to eat prior to our trip to London. It exceeded our expectations and was a wonderful night out for my wife and I. The food was so fresh and very vegan friendly. We had a wonderful meal with another couple at a communal table and it was great to learn their stories as well as tell about ourselves as well. Mildred's had a great selection of organic wines which is not common in our home area so we were excited to try a few of them. Overall Mildred's was a special meal and we recommend it to anyone looking for a very high quality restaurant in London.
Excellent food - average service,Date of visit: March 2017,"I went to Mildreds with a group of workmates. Overall it was an excellent choice - my boss is vegan so it was great to have so many excellent options for him. Even the heartiest meat eater enjoyed their food! The initial service was great, it was super busy that night but they let one of us have a table before the rest arrived, which eliminated the stress of not getting a table. We were very grateful for that. The only thing that let us down was the waiter at the table, who acted as though serving us was a massive chore/bore. He literally rolled his eyes when we asked a question, and getting the bill paid was a painful experience - even though we had a party of 7 and only paid with one card! The desserts weren't great either, but the starters and mains were excellent."
"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and great food.",Date of visit: March 2017,"Great food and variety of choice. The staff, though very busy were friendly and helpful. The food was delicious and the price very reasonable."
The customer is not important,Date of visit: March 2017,"I have been here before and had a lovely time. The food is mostly good. I advise that you avoid the buritto as it lacks in imagination. I especially love that they have sugar free deserts, which is a big factor in my return visit. My review is based on my encounter with one person, I assume she was the manager based on her bravado. Upon said return visit I requested a table said we would like just coffee and desert. The response I got was RUDE. 'We are a bit busy for just coffee and desert, this is our dinner service'. And after seeing my face contort due to the inhospitable welcome then said 'but you are welcome to put your name down'. Am I? Am I welcome? No, I dont really think I am because you pretty much told me that I am not. There had already announcements of 20 to 30 mins....in a tone that was more deterrent than please wait and we will seat you. And loud mentions that they were understaffed etc. Bla bla bla. If you're understaffed it's your problem, not the customers. Treat people with kindness and a welcoming smile, not arrogance. I walked straight out. Which I assume was the desired effect of my encounter. Well done to you."
A Foodies Vegan Paradise..!,Date of visit: February 2017,"My partner and I both visited Mildreds Restaurant in Soho on a busy Thursday in February, this being our first visit here and definitely not our last.We both shared a tasty Hummus and pitta bread starter and mains my partner had the Mushroom & Ale Pie with Mushy Minted Peas and Chunky Crispy Chips which she said was absolutely wonderful, I chose the beetroot n grain (polish) burger, so lovely and juicy and very well seasoned, definitely would recommendAll-in-all an excellent place with fabulous value You can eat quickly without feeling you've over-indulged or stay longer for a special meal with no risk of being pressurized to leave. Well worth multiple visits."
Soooooo busy and cramped :(,Date of visit: March 2017,"I've been here twice before and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I went back on Friday and I was seated downstairs......the tables are so close together you have to squeeze past to sit down, there's no room whatsoever to put your stuff and people were constantly knocking into us. Unfortunately it's impossible to enjoy your meal when you're so cramped, which is such a shame when the food is great."
Delicious food,>  >,"Had a great day out in London which included lunch at Mildred's. Arrived shortly before noon on Saturday and joined a queue of about twenty people. Once in and seated we found service was prompt and efficient but friendly and welcoming too. I'm sure the staff want diners through quickly so as to seat the next people, but we were NEVER made to feel rushed. We began with delicious 'mocktails', and a basket of artisan bread, followed by very tasty mains and we enjoyed tasting food from each other's plates. We followed up with two desserts and three spoons, both were good but the espresso creme caramel was amazing. The atmosphere is buzzing, the staff are welcoming, the food and drink are excellent - and this coming from three people who are not vegetarians. Highly recommended."
Deliciously fantastic vegetarian food!,Date of visit: March 2017,"Luckily we were late getting into Town for our lunch at Mildred's, because at 2pm the restaurant was still packed out, but amazingly a space for 3 of us became vacant. It was our first visit, but our daughter is a vegetarian and loves the food. Difficult to choose from the delicious varied menu, but our food came quickly and was so nice that we had to taste each other's dishes. Yes, there wasn't much space in the small room upstairs, but what a cosy atmosphere. Mentioned Mildred's to two friends that evening, one was already a fan and the other cant wait to pay a visit."

You don't have to be veggie to enjoy here,Date of visit: October 2016,Been many times to this restaurant. You cook book so getting there early is advisable. The food is real home cooked and tasty. Cocktails are great too.
Fantastic vegetarian food,Date of visit: February 2017,My daughters love this place. Especially the halloumi burgers. But I choose something different every time and have not been disappointed. The puddings are also great. Keep going back!
LOVE the food but arrive early to get a table.,Date of visit: August 2016,"The food here is amazing and no wonder its so popular. There's always a buzzing atmosphere and each dish does not fail to disappoint, if you are veggie, vegan or gluten free. The pie and mash is amazing! The only down fall is that you cant book. There's usually at least a 20 - 40 minute wait, however I see this as a good sign of a great restaurant. Most of the times I sit at the bar with a drink to wait for the table. Other times the wait has been so long that I had to go somewhere else. Well worth the wait but try and arrive early so to not be disappointed."
veggie delight,Date of visit: March 2017,"Visited with a friend mid week, prompt, friendly service . I'm not a vegetarian , however love vegetarian meals and had heard wonderful things about Mildred's so couldn't wait to try.Menu was gorgeous and we fancied almost everything on the menu so we decided to share 3 starters :- gyozas, flatbread with rose hummus and zatar & halloumi with spinach ( yum!) and some cocktails. Mains we shared 2 mains, the burrito which came with sour cream, guacomole and cheese and the most amazing Sri Lankan curry that came with lime rice, cashew nuts etc , really aromatic and tasty the flavours were spot on !Really lovely lovely food,informal, and very popular ( very good sign) just a shame I don't live nearer as would pop in more often.Hope to be back soon, highly recommend! :)"
Good vegetarian food,Date of visit: February 2017,We had lunch here one day in London recently. The food was fun and the staff was pleasant. It was very crowded. We actually had come for dinner the previous evening and couldn't get in.I think that the popularity is a bit much...it wasn't THAT great but it is good vegetarian food.You know what? Nothing we ate was outstanding.
WOW!! Vegetarian or not GO!!!!,Date of visit: January 2017,"Amazing food, so tasty and fresh. I would literally eat everything on the menu. Usually 20 min wait but its worth every minute. Cute decor also I love that lol. Great staff also !!"
Such good food for a non-veggie!,Date of visit: February 2017,Came here with a friend who's vegetarian without expecting much as I've never been satisfied with all vegetarian or vegan places being a big meat eater. I was shocked! I loved it here. Everything we ordered was so tasty. Had houmous & pitta and pan fried halloumi for starters. Then the sweet potato curry with basmati rice and shared a beetroot chocolate cake. So delicious! Nothing like wild food café which was horrendously bland and a waste of money. I would definitely recommend Mildreds to anyone even if you're a meat lover.
You have to wait but it is worth it,Date of visit: February 2017,Such a nice place to eat very good and valuable vegetarian food ! Don't go if you are in a hurry because you'll have to wait.
Just great in all respects,Date of visit: February 2017,"Have tried both Kings Cross and this branch and enjoyed a really tip top experience at both. The service is faultless and quick. The food is rather good - the burgers are some of the nicest I have eaten and it passed my ""I couldn't make this at home"" test. It does get busy, we shared a table with other diners (there were only two of us and it was a big table so no awkwards there) - at times there may be a wait, but we were rather lucky and have been seated straight away both times. The Soho branch has an interesting history - worth a read and a chuckle. There were some saucy prints (19th century maybe) upstairs, but once spotted they made diners laugh rather than reel in horror."
What a great find,Date of visit: February 2017,"For many years my daughter has been a vegetarian and I always try and find places to eat where they have one or maybe if we are lucky two dishes on the menu that she can eat.We found Mildreds one lunchtime before a theatre outing - the food and service was fantastic, both my husband and I are meat eaters but I had the Sri Lankan sweet potato curry and I don't think you could top it. My daughter was in her element as everything could be chosen and she throughly enjoyed her meal. So different and imaginative well done, the service was also friendly and welcoming and super quick."
,,
"Vegetarian friendly, highly recommend",Date of visit: February 2017,"The food was excellent, very tasty and innovative menu items especially vegetarian options. we had to share a table with another couple as the restaurant was fully booked and we had no booking. The service was excellent too, would highly recommend but book in advance. Great vegetarian options too!"
Delicious and filling with lovely service,Date of visit: February 2017,"If you want quick tasty imaginative vegetarian food with no fuss, then mildreds is the place to go the food is filling and tasty. And the layout is cute a bit tight. The juices are small for the price.The staff are friendly.0"
Beyond expectations!,>  >  >,"Great dinner and lunch (day 2). Fresh, friendly, sometimes crowdy - prepare to que - it's well worth the wait! :-)"
Ok Food,Date of visit: February 2017,"Really busy place that I had heard a lot about. Staff were friendly and service was good. Small place, but cosy with a nice vibe. The food was ok, but I have eaten at better vegetarian places. I had the Sri Lankan curry which was tasty, but the peas looked and tasted like they had been cooked in a microwave. My partner had the stir fry which she thoroughly enjoyed."
Nice food for a veggie/vegan place,Date of visit: February 2017,"Great service, nice ambience and good cocktails.I think it's just me but I always seem to find veggie/vegan food under seasoned and more bland. Mildred's have some decent food items especially the burgers and soul bowls. I'd avoid the curry if you like a curry with a punch as it doesn't taste very traditional to me and lacks flavour. The BBQ tofu is great and gyoza. I'd go again.Easier to get a seat at the Camden branch.Great margaritas!"
Wasn't blown away,Date of visit: February 2017,"as a vegetarian who lives in Brighton i was excited to try this place out in London! It was ok, there was a bit of a mess up with the order so unfortunately we only had 1 starter to share instead of 3 but the gyozas were nice. The main was good- quite greasy chips but the burger was ok.It was really the staff friendliness that let this place down- I don't think I saw anyone smile. Also I didn't like the table we were placed at, it was very cramped!I would probably go back one day and try something else"
Casual racism served up with a mean-girl attitude,Date of visit: September 2016,"People who had clearly arrived after us without reservations were being seated before us. We were a party of three ethnic Brits, we waited over an hour after being greeted by the woman on the door who had the most repugnant attitude. And she was clearly enjoying telling us 'another 40mins' every half 20mins. Clearly a joke...and all this on my Birthday.Eventually, after 1.5hrs waiting I had to take matters into my own hands and said woman-with-an-ipad and clicky-heels got a piece of my mind. Suddenly, 5 mins later a table magically becomes available and she seats us down....right at the back of the restaurant.Please be advised that only white people are acceptable to be seated at the front. The food was nothing to call mother about.The end."
Mildreds... NOT!,Date of visit: February 2017,"Food is ok to good to be fair, but never hot... comfort level terrible to ok depending on your table and seating position. Luck and good company will play a large part towards your overall enjoyment ...not the service, which is always average with plenty of sassy waiting staff. Expect... to queue, for ever. Warmish food guaranteed on tiny saucer sized plates. Don't hope to have any elbow room, there is none. And look forward to the service charge...LOL! The last time I had this much fun was waiting for another delayed Ryanair flight from Karlsruhe to Stansted on a Sunday. That said, my wife likes this restaurant...go figure?"
"Very, very busy!",Date of visit: February 2017,"This is a veggie resto in Soho. Some of the dishes are veggie versions of classic meat dishes, thus mushroom and ale pie, tofu burgers etc. But everything we saw was colourful and looked tasty. We had tofu burgers, chips and a side of Asian broccoli. Pistachio truffles for dessert. Coffee.All was tasty but not outstanding. Friendly service but they have moments when they are not as responsive. Don't be in a hurry here. You will have to wait for a table. The kitchen may take a bit of time to get your food out. But we like the free jug of water that appears without asking, the lack of pressure, and a good vibe. There aren't so many veggie places in London. Enjoyed it and we will be back."
"Average overall, wasn't up tp hype",Date of visit: July 2016,"Been to this place 3 times at the request of friends. I cook vegan at home so I understand the challenges and beauty of vegan cooking but it's disappointing when I find dishes and food I'm served here something I can easily improve on by making them flavorful and better at home. The service is nothing to write home about. Granted, it was full and busy but still, taking 15 minutes get the server's attention is not really good service in my book. Vegan restaurants are hard to come by and the location, ambience and customer base are great. If only they could improve on the food and service......"

Delicious food!,Date of visit: February 2017,"Arrived on a Saturday around 12:30pm, and got seated at a table straight away. Throughout our lunch it was packed, with a queue forming, so we must have been lucky when we arrived.We were impressed with how quick the food came out, considering how busy it was. Really tasty food. We had the burrito, tofu burger, and gyoza's on the side. The pricing on the menu is also very reasonable. I would highly recommend Mildred's, and will certainly be returning."
Great vegetarian food,Date of visit: February 2017,"Serves food til 11pm on a Friday. We arrived at 10.45pm, the place was still busy and they were happy to sit us and take our order. Food was delicious, nice relaxed atmosphere."
One of Londons best kept secrets,Date of visit: February 2017,"...though sadly not so much of a secret anymore, the soho branch gets so busy these days that if you want to get a spot you really need to be there before 6pm. However if you are late you can always kill time with a great cocktail. As a self confessed carnivore I was dubious about a veggie restaurant however I've gone back so many times since that I'm now a convert. My favourite dish is the sweet potato sambal, definitely worth a try!"
"Amazing, but comes with warnings",Date of visit: February 2017,"I've eaten in Mildreds twice now and cannot recommend the food enough. I've taken my partner there on both occasions as she is a vegetarian an im not. For a non vegetarian the food choice are amazing and I would recommend just picking something or asking the staff for a recommendation.Now for the downsides. The place is small and very busy and can feel a little over crowded. Once you are given your ticket do not disappear outside as the time you are given is a guestimate and it can be quicker. If you miss you name being called out you go right to the back of the cue again. The staff don't make this completely clear. My advice try one of their nice cocktails and get used to cramp spaces for your waiting time.I have to say they do operate a very tight ship and as soon as people get up to leave the place is cleared, cleaned, set and the next diners are sat down. Knowing all this I will still be going back whenever I get the chance"
Nice food but overly busy,Date of visit: February 2017,I have been excited about making a trip to Mildred's for a while. We arrived at 6.30 on a Thursday night and it was already heaving. I understand why a lot of restaurants in central London operate a no bookings policy but Mildred's customers are invited to wait in a bar area which was uncomfortably full and spilled into the restaurant. The staff were lovely and friendly and the food was certainly inventive and delicious and we had a nice time. I'm glad I tried it but I won't be rushing back - I'd rather have a dinner somewhere I can feel relaxed and you won't get that here.
A God Send!,Date of visit: January 2017,"After travelling through the UK and only eating pub food for 6 weeks this place was amazing! I took a vegetarian friend here for dinner and because of the popularity we had to wait for 30 minutes. The staff were friendly, the food was delicious and very quick. It was so good eating a fresh healthy meal for which these guys delivered. No doubt I get back there when I return to London."
Didn't get to the food ordering part....,Date of visit: December 2016,"It's very strange to write a review about a restaurant when a bad experience meant that we were not even able to eat. I don't enjoy to give a bad review, and haven't before this one, but 3* seems too kind as that is for 'average' and this experience was way below average. So this is how the evening went...In London and due to meet friends for dinner at 7pm. At 6pm I went into Mildreds, it was extremely busy on a week night, the restaurant itself is very small and there wasn't a lot of room to move. This didn't put me off however, it made me excited as I was sure it meant that the food was probably really amazing (and maybe it is! I still can't tell) So I've nudged my way through the crowd and queue to find the hostess and asked how long for a table for three. The hostess told me that the wait would be one hour, and a quote from her mouth ""Probably more than one hour"" well that was no problem, I was happy to wait as the rest of the party hadn't even arrived yet. She gave me a card with a number on and took my name, and that was that. I was excited! I squeezed my way back out to the exit and was relieved to take a deep breath of fresh air outside the restaurant, which frankly couldn't have held another person due to the lack of space.40 minutes later, the rest of the party arrives outside Mildreds door, we squeeze ourselves back inside and decide to try and wait nearby the hostess, it couldn't hurt to be early for our reservation after all, could it?I approached the hostess to show her the number on our card and she referred to her tablet with the queue on I presume. She informed us that she 'had just called my name but there was no answer so had to move on to the next table' I told her that I understood, but we were back a lot earlier than the time she had stated (over an hour, she had said) She said that the time was just a guideline, not a guarantee.I told her it was no problem, we would just wait for the next available table. the hostess then told us that it doesn't work like that, and we'd need to go to the back of the queue, so probably wait another hour. Well I was a bit shocked by this to be honest. I told her that we'd already waited, could we not sit at the next available table for three? No, there was no negotiation. She told me that I shouldn't have left the restaurant in the first place, so that I would hear my name being called. First of all, the hostess sadly didn't tell me this before, and secondly, I don't believe Mildreds takes into account that it would have been an uncomfortably cramped to wait in the location, I was more comfortable standing outside in the street which was 0 degrees on this day. So, with no apology for the misunderstanding and unwilling to wait until 8pm for a queue I'd joined at 6pm we left and ate somewhere else. I'm not ignoring the fact that it is great that Mildreds had said the wait would be over an hour, when the wait was infact 40 minutes, that's great news. But the 'don't leave the restaurant' aspect must be stated at the start. I'm not expecting special treatment, and I certainly don't think myself more important than any other customer, but I do believe the more professional way to deal with this situation would be to have tried to fit our table of three in once one was available, rather than making us go to the back of the queue. I can't comment on the food, so again, I feel guilty for 2* as had the food been amazing I could forgive everything, even 'not bothered' attitude staff. But my experience in this restaurant was poor, and unfortunately on principle I won't try to go back."
Very cool innovative veggie restaurant!,Date of visit: February 2017,"Sweet potato curry is phenomenal - definitely recommend. Tofu burger was really nice - too much bread made it a bit stodgy. Chips not great - sweet potato fries much nicer! Guacamole top notch. Waitresses were kind of not bothered, will definitely be back! Xb"
Very good food at good price,Date of visit: February 2017,"Excellent food for vegans and vegetarians, service was quick and prices are reasonable. However the tables and too close together so end up sharing with others. Did get very busy at dinner time so clearly has a good reputation."
"Excellent food, arrive early!",>,This was one of the best veggie meals I've ever eaten and reasonably priced for central London. However you can't book so make sure you arrive before the 7/8pm rush. The service wasn't the most attentive or friendly and the waiter made the classic mistake of giving my bank card to my boyfriend to pay the bill which is always super irritating. I will be going back despite this!
,,
Great food,Date of visit: February 2017,"Visited Tuesday at 6pm, Jam packed and an hour to wait, so we went somewhere else. Returned Wednesday at 4.50pm - seated straight away, food was quick and delicious. I had the smoked lentil burger with fries, which were actually chunky chips and my daughter had the squash and bean burrito. the food was excellent and I will go back next time I am in London. The place was full by 5.20pm and people were starting to wait in the bar area. It is a cosy restaurant and you are not able to book, so either go early or be prepared to wait.............it's worth it. £12 each"
Excellent all round,Date of visit: February 2017,"Visited here last night, arriving at around 7 to a busy, bustling front bar and told the wait would be 1 - 1 1/2 hours, but as we managed to get a seat in the window decided to enjoy the cocktails and wait it out. So glad we did. We were actually seated in around 45 mins and enjoyed one of the best veggie meals we've ever had. Everything was packed with flavour, portions were generous and reasonably priced and service was great. Nothing to fault and we'll worth a visit."
"Great food, bad service",Date of visit: February 2017,"We turned up and were seated, but then it's as if the staff forgot about us, there is only about 25 tables and 4/5 staff on so it was impressive that they managed to do this. Some time later they took our order and brought the food which was delicious, but then no one came to check on the meal, offer us more drinks, or give us the bill, the basics of service. We had to walk to the till to pay, and they had the audacity to charge a 12.5% service charge, for basically bringing some food to a table then ignoring the customers. 2/3 tables around us seemed to be in a similar position, even the table next to us who had been given a bill had to wait around 15 minutes for the staff to bring the card food 4/5 Service 2/5"
So yummy!,Date of visit: January 2017,"Went after a long, cold day in London, and it hit the spot! Me and my friend couldn't think of anywhere to eat before my train home, so I looked up vegetarian restaurants and it was the first hit. The menu is quite mature, with many of the options being vegan. We were seated quickly and automatically given a jug of water which I love. I ordered the tofu and white bean sausages, whilst my friend ordered the halloumi burger. It arrived within 10 minutes and was delicious. Mine was vegan, and if I had the ability to cook that sort of vegan food at home, I'd happily go the extra step and convert. Amazing flavours, just Gorgeous. They didn't take ages to give us the bill at the end (even though it was busy) which was great. Most of the big dishes were £12, which I guess is pretty reasonable for central London pricing. Certainly worth it for those flavours. Would highly recommend."
Nice vegan food,Date of visit: November 2016,"Bit overcrowded, had to wait for table 1 hour, but food is great so in the end it was worh it. Only bad thing is you get feeling like you are in hospital waiting for a doctor haha"
Great food but disappointing service,Date of visit: January 2017,We tried to go here for dinner at 7.30pm on a Thursday night but it was tiny and packed when we arrived and we were told there was an hour wait so we went somewhere else. We tried coming back the next Tuesday at 6.30pm and met the same experience so waited at the packed bar for 45 minutes. We were then seated at a shared table with another couple which I understand as they were trying to make the most of the space but it was quite awkward. I had the sweet potato curry which was delicious. We opted not to have dessert so were given the bill within 2 minutes of our main course plates being cleared without being asked which we thought was incredibly rude. All up we were seated for less than 45 minutes and we felt that they couldn't wait for us to leave so they could seat more people. I won't be back to the Soho branch but perhaps will try their other restaurants and hope that the customer service is better there.
vegetarian cafe,Date of visit: October 2016,busy vegetarian cafe with great food and a buzz about the place. Love in here when I visit central London.
Fab Birthday meal!,>,Wow! Even better than last time! The Bourbon Tofu skewers were sooooo tasty and I also loved the sweet potato curry. Hubby liked his hummus and classic burger and we both enjoyed out desserts and bottle of biodynamic wine and fig martinis! Service was brisk and efficient. I can't wait to go again!
vegetarian restuarant.,Date of visit: January 2017,"We'd intended to visit this vegetarian restaurant for a while. But when we did we found it crowded and noisy. However the food was nice. And at least we managed to arrive at a time when we didn't have to queue, as many folk clearly did do."
Worth the wait!,Date of visit: January 2017,"We arrived early on a Friday night and had to queue for an hour - but it was definitely worth it! We had a few drinks in their bar area and got given a lovely corner table for dinner. Interesting menu, we especially enjoyed the espresso martinis and chocolate rose & pistachio truffles. We will be back :)"
,,
Worth the wait,Date of visit: January 2017,"I have wanted to visit Mildred's for a long time.We knew there would be a wait, so we took that into account when visiting.We arrived at 2pm and was told there would be a 45min-1hr wait.We stayed in the bar area and ordered drinks whilst waiting. The bar is extremely small and cramped but luckily 2 of us managed to get bar stools.We were seated after 45 minutes upstairs.The staff weren't particularly friendly, but they served well and weren't rude at all.The best bit is the food. We had starters and mains. I really wanted a dessert but I just couldn't fit it in.We are a party of a meateater, a pescatarian, a vegan and a gluten free vegan. We all enjoyed our food very much."
Great view from the loo!,Date of visit: January 2017,"Fabulous friendly staff, lovely busy at,osphere and some of the best food my daughters and I have eaten as vegan and vegetarians.Loved it and will definitely go back. Thinking of buying the book."
Birthday Treat,Date of visit: January 2017,"Simply had to visit for my Partners 40th as its one of those places of legend! They have a no booking policy so you have to turn up and take a card if it's busy and wait in the bar until called. For me, one thing says all you need to know about this restaurant, it was a fairly quiet night in Soho, midweek, and most places were half empty, this place was rammed!That said, we only waited 10 minutes for a table for two although whilst we were seated I clocked people waiting for almost an hour for a table for 4. The food was fantastic and I bought my partner one of the cookbooks so we can try some of the recipes at home :-)Well worth a visit......"
Vegan Food at its best!!,Date of visit: January 2017,"I'm not vegetarian or vegan and I wouldn't stop to think about going back here time and time again!! The food is glorious!!Amazing flavours and variety, with good sized portions. Excellent service and a really warming cosy atmosphere.It's really popular so be prepared to wait as you can't book for small parties. But it's well worth the wait!!"
One of my favourite restaurants,Date of visit: September 2016,"I've visited the Soho and Kings Cross Mildred's. I like it so much I bought the cookbook. Lovely good, great atmosphere, great service. Drinks are good too, from the freshly squeezed juices to the cocktails - their porn star martini is ace.Don't avoid it if you're not a veggie or vegan, if you appreciate great food go visit. If you are veggie or vegan - and if you need to avoid gluten, you'll appreciate the clear guidance on which dishes cater for you. I can recommend everything I've ever tried! But the gluten-free vegan chocolate peanut butter brownie with ice-cream is one of my all-time favourite puddings."
OMG Delicious Vegan Food with a Bistro vibe!,>,"My SO and I have recently become Vegan and so we've been on the hunt for restaurants that serve awesome Vegan food. Hit the jackpot at Mildreds Soho! Yes, the wait was long - around 50 mins at 5pm on a Sunday but we figured that many people couldn't be wrong. Plenty of choice for Vegans - everything we had was delicious! My stuffed pepper was huge and they were happy to pack up the rest to go. I'm avoiding alcohol at the mo but the cocktails looked fabu so will definitely be trying those in the future. The service was exceptional - considering they were literally rushed off their feet - and I loved the Bistro vibe (completely different to Mildreds in Camden - which is more cafe). Brilliant and so happy to have discovered!"
Yummy,Date of visit: January 2017,"They don't take bookings and so you wait, and wait. It was worth it. I had a soup (can't remember what kind) it was delicious, followed by a ricotta with truffle both dishes were delicious. So, a packed Restaurant with what appeared to be very happy Diners. So go and enjoy"
Disappointment,Date of visit: January 2017,"First we wait 45 min for table, had a drink at the bar, which was nice. The dining room was very full noisy and small. For starters we had dumplings and artichokes but they were ok, nothing special. Mains filled peppers and classic burger. Pepper was so bad I couldn't eat it,too much cinnamon and wierd sweet taste. Burger only taste like eating smoke.. Sweet potato fries were over cooked so crap also. Service was unprofessional and rude. Never going again to this place."
Veggie love.,Date of visit: April 2016,"I went here with my Vegetarian sister and her partner, when they were in town. This is one of the best veggie finds in London. We sat upstairs, which seemed quite a bit more spacious than downstairs with a very attentive waiter during lunch time. We shared 3 amazing starters, and all had various tasty curries for our mains. We also loved the sounds of the desserts so much that we had to try. The only part of the meal that could have been improved slightly was the Crumble, but the other desserts were AMAZING."
A venue for family and friends,Date of visit: November 2016,"MIldreds has three branches in London, Soho, Camden and Kings Cross. I know the Soho branch. Our home is vegetarian, so we support vegetarian and vegan restaurants.The food is amazing, the clientele range from younger to older and it is edgy and noisy. In a good way. This is not a formulaic chain restaurant in the West End. It is authentic and has been since 1988, challenging the brown food/earthenware model of meat-free dining.There are no reservations, so allow time and enjoy the vibe of the bar as you wait for a table to come free. Highly recommended!!"

Well worth the long wait for exhibition tired feet,>,"Myself and my parents came here straight after seeing the Caravaggio exhibition at the National on its final Saturday. Upon being told there was an hour's wait (we had expected *a* wait) my Dad looked at me - we had been excited about coming here for weeks as we had all been before but never together. I looked at him and said 'well where else are we going to go?' Although Soho doesn't leave you wanting for vegetarian and vegan options, we would have spent forever trying to decide. So we stayed for hot chocolate, virgin cocktails and a fantastic house red. I'm not sure how long it was before our table was ready but upon sitting and being given our menus we were given plenty of time to make a decision - we weren't rushed for food choices as if our table was being eyed up by the next patron.My Dad opted for the mushroom pie, my Mum the halloumi burger and I chose two starters; the hummus and tempeh dish and the barbeque tofu. We also had sweet potato fries on the side and I ummed and ahhed over asking to try the beetroot with vegan labneh. I'm not a fan of beetroot but I have never seen vegan labneh before! Labneh was a big part of my pre-vegan diet on my honeymoon in Jordan and I was desperate to try it.Our food came out promptly and the feast began, with us all taking little bites and nibbles from each others plates. The beetroot was actually delicious, and the labneh out of this world. Mildred's succeeded in actually making crispy skinned sweet potato fries, which seems to be a difficulty for most places that now serve this almost ubiquitous menu item. My Dad's pie was delicious too. As for my smaller plates? The hummus was velvety and the smoky tempeh was the perfect complimenting texture and taste. The flatbreads were delicious discs of carbohydrate heaven. The marinade on my tofu was thick and sticky, and I'm sure I ate it in a very sensible and alluring fashion, absolutley not getting it all over my face. The vegetables in the accompanying slaw were crunchy and fresh and the ranch dressing had the acidic tang to cut through the intensity of the marinade.For desert, coffee, the beetroot cake and the ice cream were ordered and very much enjoyed. The coffee sauce for the ice cream had an appropriate kick without being over powering, as I am still a baby exploring coffee and its tastes after years of despising it. The beetroot cake was rich and fudgy, with caramelised pecans my mum inexplicably didn't like but I was happy to polish off.Service was friendly and attentive without being obtrusive, which I think is the mark of staff who understand their patrons and their needs and adjust accordingly. I would absolutley reccommend Mildred's to anyone, from the permanent carnivore to the seasoned vegan. Enough here to seem familiar to a traditional palette (pies, burritos etc) and enough to tempt those who have seen just about every animal-free innovation (that labneh!)."
Very disappointing,Date of visit: January 2017,"Visited on a mid-week evening - the only positive was our actual waitress who was really friendly and nice. The rest of the Mildreds' experience was poor.There are plenty of busy no reservations restaurants around and I have never had an issue with any of them - as this isn't a new restaurant you would expect that they have this process running smoothly. However, it pays to be rude at this restaurant and that's not the kind of place I like to eat at, after registering with the hostess and then when our party was complete waiting patiently at the front of the waiting area for her to return from seating another party, some guy shouts over us to the hostess and she lets him push in infront of us and seats him and his guest. She then proceeds to tell us that there won't be an unshared table for another 20 minutes. We opt for a shared table, but on sitting down another party was already leaving and thus there was a table free.How can a hostess working in a busy restaurant not only not be able to seat guests in the correct order but also have no idea about when tables have finished up? When we asked for menus - these were pretty much thrown onto the table without even the slightest smile. The food was very average - nothing particularly tasty although the portions were sizeable - but from some of the other reviews it sounds like we were lucky not to get burnt food!I'm sure Mildreds will continue to be packed everynight but it's definitely not one I would recommend especially given that there are other good vegetarian options around - such as Sagar, Ethos or Vantra - all of which have nicer staff and make for a much more enjoyable dining experience."
Honestly Poor quality,Date of visit: December 2016,"I don't ever write bad reviews about anywhere unless I really have to due to a bad experience. The staff were fine as helpful as they could possibly be considering some days it is ridiculously cramped and over crowded, noisy with small low uncomfortable tables where you can just hear everyone's conversations it's so cramped in. The food is what can I say Below mediocre, flavourless! I ordered an Indian style curry and some other dishes - it was awful! Tasteless and the vegetables weren't nice and one of the hard unwanted bits of the veg was put in basically lazily cut up veg! Whoever rates this above a 2/ 3 star honestly needs to review their taste buds, even if I tried to like it I couldn't, I was expecting so much more. My review will not have any influence on the booming business of this place, however the whole meal did not sit right on my stomach after and anyone who considers themselves to have high standards and a very acquired taste buds I would never recommend this place."
Last minute decision was a good one,Date of visit: January 2017,Went to Mildred's after dinner plans at other restaurant fell through. Was glad it did. Great food and very attentive and friendly staff.
Lost it's appeal,Date of visit: January 2017,"We came here quite often 5-7 years ago. I was veggie but a very fussy one & thought this place was great. Since then I've expanded my veggie tastes a lot & cook a great variety myself. Sadly, this means that now revisiting Mildred's I feel I could cook better for much cheaper. I'm also very disappointed to see that the menu has barely changed in all that time - I understand that this is a tough call for a restaurant though as some people like to return for their favourites. During tonight's visit my husband & I both had burger and fries. Mine came together on a plate but the fries were cold. My husband got his burger at the same time (on a side plate) but had to wait for his (hot,fresh) fries that later came in a bowl. The burger was large and very filling but a little bland. On the plus side the portions are always very filling, the sweet potato fries are always good and the staff are usually always very friendly & efficient. When we arrived we were told there'd be a 45/50min wait but luckily we were actually seated in less than 20.It's a shame but I don't think I'll be rushing back or recommending it as highly as I once did."
A very happy birthday meal,Date of visit: January 2017,"I arrived before the five other members of our party into an incredibly crowded restaurant entrance and bar area. The place was packed, and I despaired of even catching the eye of a staff member to get on the table waiting list. I needn’t have; Pip spotted me quickly and I was on the system for a table for six, though I think this could only really be expedited once all my group had arrived. The way she handled the whole queuing process was pretty awesome; many people were tired, hungry and impatient (MUCH more than I was! ;-) ) and yet she seemed to rise above it all, keeping people well-informed and happy, and making even a long wait a pleasure.The pleasure of waiting was also helped by cocktails. There was a bit of a wait here too, slightly less explicably, and probably the least friendly service of my visit. That is relative, though; the general standard of customer service is SO high that you tend to get hyper-critical. Cocktails are good. Be aware – a “medium spiced” Bloody Mary may seem hotter than many highly peppered ones elsewhere.Food and drink: Once seated (a fair wait, it has to be said) we ordered and settled down to enjoy our evening. We had two vegans in the group, with four confirmed carnivores. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food. I had the Ricotta and truffle tortelloni, an excellent dish, with other meat eaters having a burger or the mushroom and ale pie. The house red, Hoopoe Nero d’Avola Syrah is an excellently drinkable wine that was robust enough for the strong flavours being enjoyed.All of us had desert, with most going for the fudge cake. I wanted it to be more chocolatey, but it was still good. Service: friendly, efficient, informative and quick. Very good!Value: Mildreds is a leading London restaurant in a prime location. It is always packed, in my experience. I wouldn’t expect it to be cheap. Ingredients are clearly fresh and of the best quality, and often of fairly exotic type. The only vegetarian restaurant that I know as well would be Food for Friends in Brighton, which is, if anything, slightly pricier. I think Mildreds gives value for money. In any case, my son paid, as it was my birthday! ;-) Thanks, Tom!This was my third or fourth time at Mildreds. It won't be the last. Alongside Food for Friends as mentioned above, if I really wanted to show a carnivore friend what vegetarian and vegan food can be, I would bring them here. Nuff said."
Awesome veggie options,Date of visit: December 2016,"Came here on two recommendations and was not disappointed.Only issue queue times, get here by 5 pm for dinner or you may be queuing for a while, it's worth it thoug."
"Amazing food, terrible service",Date of visit: January 2017,"We had a lovely meal in Mildreds today, we shared 3 starters, 2 mains with 2 sides with a bottle of wine and we finished all of it ! I just want to point out that our terrible and rude waitress almost ruined it for us. No smile, no meal checking, we felt pushed out when she put the bill on the table before we could finish our drinks. But really great vegetarian food !"
Best service I have ever had!,>,"I came with specific needs - a wedding present for some vegan friends. I knew I couldn't book, so I came early and explained my needs. I can't believe how caring the staff were. They listened and genuinely cared that the meal and evening should be perfect for me and my friends. I can't fault them. Oh, and the food was great. My mushroom and ale pie had the most tasty gravy and I couldn't believe I wasn't eating meat or dairy. My friends loved it as well - they had a rice dish and a burrito. As soon as the place was full - which it remained all evening - the music was turned off and the hubbub from the diners gave us all the privacy we needed in this small, intimate but very cosy restaurant."
Fabulous Food and Great Service,Date of visit: November 2016,"We visited Mildreds for the first time in November on a busy Friday night. The service was great, nice and quick without feeling rushed. The standout however was the food which was absolutely delicious! We had a starter and a main each but were too stuffed to eat dessert, although the pudding menu look just as incredible! I would highly recommend Mildreds for fab vegetarian food and can't wait until I'm next there!"
,,
Great Vegetarian Restaurant,Date of visit: November 2016,"Something for everyone on the menu, never hungry when i leave, always good value, great burgers and stir fries. Friendly staff. Worth the wait if you have to wait for a table"
Sweet potatoes fries from heaven,Date of visit: December 2016,"I have recently decided to become a vegan, and visiting this restaurant definitely made me feel even better about my choice. Mildreds shows that it's possible to make awesome, tasty food based on vegan ingredients. I took the ""classic"" burger."
Always our go-to vegetarian restaurant when in London,>  >,"We have eaten here several times and love it. Reading the other TA reviews about slow service, we have never experienced that, but we always go mid afternoon. This time, our waiter was Rubin... fast, friendly, efficient. This location is cozy; in other words, the tables are squeezed together to seat as many people as possible in this small Soho space. Beetroot and chocolate fudge cake, and the cheesecake were delicious!"
First visit to Mildreds,Date of visit: December 2016,"Very cramped, no cloakroom facilities and badly situated toilets.(Right by kitchen area)Service haphazard but pleasant, food was good,would visit again if had lots of time to spare."
Underwhelming food and poor service,Date of visit: December 2016,"My vegetarian boyfriend and I had been looking forward to Mildred's for a long time, especially given its good reputation. We arrived at around 2.30pm and there was a half an hour wait. We were happy enough in the bar and we enjoyed a tasty cocktail. The problems started when we were taken over to our table. It was almost 20 minutes before we managed to get the waitress's attention to take our order. The staff were clearly busy but we noticed them spending time setting up new tables rather than serving the existing customers. it was really hard to get anyone's attention.Our waitress was a real misery, making no pleasantries and refusing to smile throughout. She seemed put out when I politely told her that my drink was wrong. She looked so unhappy about being there that I thought twice about telling her that there was no cheese on my burger. It was all so awkward. The food was pretty disappointing too. Although the gyoza were as good most, the classic burgers were far too big and dry. I have a huge appetite but I could barely eat any of it. The fries were not fries and the sweet potato ones were particularly soft. There's a rather hefty tip automatically added to the already pricey bill. In light of the poor food and service this didn't seem fair. I can't say that we'll be coming back."
Pre show dinner,Date of visit: December 2016,Took my non vegetarian family here as the place had been recommended to me by a friend. They really enjoyed the food as did I. I had the artichoke followed by the curry! Followed by the ice cream. It's absolutely true what others say about the tables being rammed in really close together and being popular - we arrived at 420pm and had to wait to be seated.
Beautiful food but very over priced!,Date of visit: December 2016,"I had my first ever vegan curry here (sweet potato, coconut milk and pea rice) it was delicious and I absolutely cannot fault the food. I was so impressed! But my one qualm is the pretentious crowd this place attracts with the pretentious price to match! I understand it's a slightly more niché market but it is growing rapidly and the prices should really reflect that!"
"Long wait, average food",Date of visit: December 2016,"I was looking forward to eating here with my girlfriend after reading the great reviews and glowing praise it has received, but left somewhat disappointed. We arrived at around 7 pm so anticipated a long wait and was told an hour to an hour and a half, it tuned out be the latter. There really isn't much room at all to wait inside the restaurant itself so you are better off going for a drink elsewhere for as long as you dare to. Once we sat down to eat, we ordered the goats cheese and thyme fondue which turned out be the best part of the meal and was delicious, but it only came with one small piece of bread, which was nowhere near enough, our waiter though gave us some more after we asked. The mains we ordered were the christmas special and the burrito which were decent, but not spectacular. I would strongly advise to go at a quite time, otherwise I do not feel it is worth the wait."
Amazing food but expect a wait,Date of visit: December 2016,"We arrived around 6.30 on a Monday and it took an hour to get seated. The area to wait in is so tiny and cramped but luckily we got a space and had drinks to make time go faster. The food is really good, would recommend going but wouldn't rush back simply because it's annoying not being able to reserve a table.Really nice staff though who were so lovely despite how manic it seemed"
Outstanding food,Date of visit: December 2016,One of the best places for real food in London.Always friendly service.Great wines too.No reservations so one has to wait & not all food is available all the time. A mark of a good eatery.
,,
Outstanding vegan dishes,Date of visit: December 2016,"Great and delicious food, with various vegan options. The tofu burger is simply one of the best I have ever had. The only issue is that this place is super busy (cant blame anyone, they have great food), so waiting time might be a problem. They have other, less busy branches around London in case Soho is too busy."
Rude waiting staff,Date of visit: December 2016,We recently travelled to London and decided to eat at Mildreds as we'd heard amazing things about it but sadly we left feeling really disappointed.We were seated straight away and our waitress came over to our table and without a single smile or 'hello' she just said 'you ready?' and took our order. The food came out within 5 minutes and we'd finished our food by the time our drinks finally arrived (about 15 minutes later). We didn't have a check up from our waitress and we weren't asked if we needed anything else despite ordering bread that never arrived. Our food was cleared and we weren't offered a dessert menu or coffee. We ended up having to wave for about 10 minutes to try and get the bill and when we got it she came straight over said nothing and took our payment and we left. The worst thing of all is that there's a 12.5% service charge included which quite frankly sometimes makes me think waiting staff get away with being less personable and friendly because they feel as if they don't have to work for their tip. Yes it's optional but the majority of people wouldn't feel comfortable asking for it to be taken off.The food was good but we wouldn't go back because of the way we felt when we left. We were in and out within 35 minutes but would have had coffee and dessert had it been offered. I understand that if it's busy you don't necessarily have time to chat to your tables but a simple acknowledgement of our presence would have been common courtesy.
First visit and loved it!,Date of visit: December 2016,"This was my first visit to a vegetarian restaurant and I am a convert! My friend and I arrived at 6.30pm on a Thursday and were told that the wait would be 40 mins, 20 mins later we were seated. Our shared starters of artichoke crostini, haloumi and spinach, and tofu were all excellent- I would definitely have these again and highly recommend the dishes. For the main course we both opted for the classic burger (my first vegetarian burger) and I didn't really like this unfortunately. The broccoli side dish and basil mayo that accompanied our sweet potato fries were both delicious though. For dessert we opted to share the cheesecake, which was too sweet in my opinion. The bill came to about £70 with service and a glass of wine each- which is very reasonable. Service was brilliant, the atmosphere was great and the starters were a real treat— I will definitely be returning."
Delicious vegan food - if you can get in,Date of visit: December 2016,"Had a great vegan meal here - truly outstanding, creative and delicious dishes. I loved the barbecue tofu, among many other things. Service was friendly and prompt. However, you have to eat dinner very early to avoid a lengthy wait in crowded bar area or outside. I am not willing to wait an hour for any restaurant, and they don't take reservations. If you are like me - eat early!!!"
Excellent food and a great service,Date of visit: December 2016,Mildreds definitely has many excellent reviews. I would like to highlight it is not only excellent vegetarian/vegan food that makes it unique. It's also its ability to meet dietary requirements of people with unusual allergies. Also - friendly and relaxed writing stuff makes this place very pleasant to visit. I've been in Mildreds several times and there will be several more for sure.
Over rated,Date of visit: December 2016,"Me and my girlfriend are both veggie. From Brighton but took my gf to london for the weekend for her birthday and thought this would be the perfect place to eat.We got told an hour wait, which ended up being 45 mins! that was nice. However, when the food came, we were honestly disappointed. We've had a lot of veggie food all over Europe and this was not what we expected. It was average food i could make at home, and after elbowing our way through soho and waiting in the packed bar for 45 mins, it just wasn't good enough. I had a burrito, which was average at best. my gf has the mushroom and ale pie, which was similarly average at best. We had a hummus starter which was the only thing i would call good. With all the great reviews and the wait we had for a table, this just didn't cut it. I feel awful saying it, the service was great, the manager did so well despite how many people were crammed into the bar, but it just wasn't good enough. Sorry."
Amazing vegan and veggie food!,Date of visit: November 2016,I went here last month in the late afternoon before a show. I am a vegetarian and I went here with my vegan sister and my mum who eats meat. The three of us had the most amazing meal here! Everything we ordered was full of flavour and absolutely delicious. My mum did not miss the meat at all. The wine was fantastic too! Great atmosphere. It was more expensive than what we usually pay for a meal out but worth every penny! Will certainly return!
Best vegetarian ever,Date of visit: November 2016,So much choice so much delicious food clearly hugely popular and know why as there is a huge choice of fabulous food served by efficient friendly staff .highly recommend and will return
2nd time round,Date of visit: December 2016,This was the second time of visiting and we were really pleased we managed to get a table as it was so busy (which also says a lot)Excellent choice of delicious food and drinks which are clearly explained on the menu and served up by very friendly and accommodating staff.A must if you are looking for a great vegetarian restaurant whilst in London.
We came back & it was even better than we remembered.,Date of visit: December 2016,"We visited Mildred's back in December 2011 & have finally got back to revisiting. It's only taken this long as we don't visit Soho that often! Anyhow, we tipped up after going to see School of Rock for a matinee performance so I guess it as around 5-ish. We got seated straight away but within about 15 mins it was packed and there were people waiting in the bar area and outside on the pavement. This time of night be prepared for a fairly speedy service as they like to get you fed and watered and out to fit in as many covers as possible I guess. Having said that, we knew the score and didnt feel rushed. The waitress was friendly and efficient and took good care of us (nb the 12.5% service charge is included in the bill so don't tip twice unless you mean to).To start Liz has the char-grilled artichokes which she loved and I had hummus and flat bread with pine nuts and tempee. Bloomin' gorgeous or what??? Main course Liz had the Shri-lankan lentil and green bean curry which she said was gorgeous and I had the smoky mushroom pie with chips and minted mushy peas. I love pie and chips but this was really one of the best I've ever had. Amazing smoked mushrooms in a gravy to die for in a puff pastry pie. Chips were chunky and the minted peas just topped it off perfectly. We were full but so we could stay a bit longer in the cosmopolitan ambience we ordered dessert. I had a plum and marscapone cheesecake that was glorious and Liz had chocolate fudge cake with chocolate orange sauce which was rich and full of taste. A superb meal in an unpretentious but cosmopolitan atmosphere. My only criticism was the lack of non-alcoholic beer (humour me, I like beer but not alcohol).Great meal that exceeded our already high expectations. Bill came to £68 including service."

Best Vegetarian Resturant in London,Date of visit: November 2016,"It's a bold claim, but this really is the best vegetarian restaurant in the city and definitely worth the wait. I've visited at least 10 times, and it's a place I often take my non-veggie friends who also love the food. For London, the food is very reasonably priced, it's as much as you'd pay in a chain such as Pizza Express and I think it's definitely worth it. The restaurant also has a great atmosphere as it's always full of people. The food is simple but not lacking in flavour. It's all cooked on site, using fresh ingredients. The staff are always friendly and accommodating. Their cookbook is also fantastic, it's one of my most used."
Amazing Vegetarian/Vegan Cuisine,Date of visit: December 2016,"Although I typically don't queue for anything, particularly restaurants, our daughter and her boyfriend wanted to try Mildred's and, wow, it paid off. The waiting experience was efficient and really friendly. We were shown to a table in one of the upper rooms and were served by Ruben who was truly outstanding. Friendly, efficient and funny. The food was stunning. I had the artichoke appetiser followed by the wild mushroom pie. Both were superb."
Very poor service,Date of visit: November 2016,"This was the first time I had ever visited Mildreds - it was on my birthday and I had really been looking forward to it as I am a big fan of veggie food. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed in Mildreds and cannot recommend it.Let me start by saying the food was fantastic - that is why I have rated Mildred's a two rather than a one, however the service was absolutely appalling.My boyfriend and I ordered starters, and then a main course to share. The starters came out in good time, but our main did not appear. After approximately 30 minutes of waiting we thought it was a bit strange, and tried to catch our server's attention, our server seemed to be deliberately avoiding our table and after ten minutes of trying to indicate that we were waiting, we eventually managed to speak to another member of staff. We explained that we'd been waiting an incredibly long time for our main and she said she would go to check on it. Our server came over shortly after to say that our main was now being made, it was pretty obvious that our ticket had been lost, however no explanation was given and no compensation was offered. By the time our main arrived it had been a full hour since we had finished our starters.At the best of times this would have been incredibly poor service, but this had been meant to be a special birthday meal, and the hour long delay in service spoilt our evening. There have been other restaurants where we had less of a wait time, and have been profusely apologised to and had our mains for free. I was shocked that after such a long wait time we received no significant apology and weren't given anything to compensate us for our hour long wait between courses."
Vegan sardines... but worth it,>  >,"The food here is absolutely amazing. The burger is probably the best vegan burger I've eaten, and the BBQ tofu steak was unbelievably delicious. And thank God for that as we had waited 40 minutes for a table. This wouldn't put me off going again as the food was out of this world and still reasonably priced, we had a bottle of wine, beer and another glass of wine, tofu burger, and three side dishes and the bill came to under £60. Just manage your expectations though, you will be waiting ages, crammed into the bar area with a load of other hungry vegans like little vegan sardines, but it's worth it."
Dinner for two,Date of visit: November 2016,"Just loved it. Atmosphere and food fab. Fresh, inventive and tasty. Would recommend to all. Welcoming."
Amazing food,Date of visit: November 2016,Great vegan food got there around 6 on a sat and was already bustling but got seating pretty quick. The burger was amazing as was the vegan cheese . Pretty much every we all are was phenomenal been back a couple of times since .
Fantastic,Date of visit: November 2016,"Heard about this place, in various health food magazines. On a recent visit to London decided to give a try. Got there for 12 noon when they open as I do not like to Que. They do take bookings.We were one of the first in. frantic but professional services. 2 salads and 2 juices were ordered. The salads when they arrived were excellent. One plate with 5 individual salads, all very tasty, especially the beetroot. The juices did not arrive, when prompted to the waitress, she forgot to pass on but will be here in 2 minutes and we would not be charged for them. What more can you ask.Would thoroughly recommend this restaurant, bought their book, excellent."
Perfect food!,Date of visit: November 2016,"My party was looking for a restaurant with very specific requirements. I needed a place near The Wyndham Theatre, a place that would cater for my elder daughters coeliac disease and a place that also catered for my younger daughters veganism, after an internet search Mildreds seemed spot on. A vegetarian restaurant that has a wide range of gluten free. You can only book for larger parties, so the 3 of us turned up and were lucky to get the end of a table for 6 that we shared with another group of 3. The food was divine, some of the best I have tasted and definitely the best vegetarian food I have had, (I am a full blown carnivore). My gluten intolerent daughter was blown away at how many desserts she could choose from, it is a change for her. We would definitely return here, it was very busy but the food is worth it."
Amazing vegan food!,>  >  >,Wonderful food and atmosphere. Really enjoyed our lunch here. Pie for hubby and burger for me. Great service and atmosphere too. Packed out and queuing out of the door! Go and enjoy!
The best of the best.,>,"When we come to London we unpack and head straight here! The food is amazing. My daughter is vegan and I'm a veggie. My favourites are the halloumi and mushroom burger and mushroom and ale pie. The vegan basil mayo is amazing and we bought Mildred's Cookbook to get the recipe. If you go late afternoon you can be seated quite quickly leave it until the evening and there will be a wait, which leaves time to sample the cocktails. The vegan chocolate, peanut brownie made us tear up a little it was so delicious. We Mildred's."
,,
One word...excellent,Date of visit: November 2016,One of the best chocolate and beetroot vegan brownies I've ever had. Not to mention the delicious tofu burger and sweet pot fries - I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu! Service exceptional and atmosphere informal and friendly.
who said you can't eat cheap in London?,>,"Pleasent surprise when I found this excellent vegetarian place in Soho - London. They have a great menu and a great table full of great salads. That's what I ate, and my god! soooo good. We got there just at 12h and few moments later, the restaurant was full. Great vibe and service! Very cheap!"
Tasty & great value for money,Date of visit: November 2016,"A very busy restaurant - front of house here have table turning down to an art.3 of us waited 20 minutes and were just ordering a drink at the bar when the table became free.A clear simple menu with something for everyone made eating here a joy.The food is vegetarian & vegan & all contents are clearly marked - the waiting staff take time to explain should you have any allergy or dietary restriction questions Once ordered, the food appears quickly.As a confirmed omnivore it was a treat to eat a gluten free Sweet Potato curry with accompaniments with a side order of Tamarind baked beetroot with Labneh & Pistachios.My fellow diners had Mushroom Pie with Chips and minted mushy peas - big chunky mushroom pieces in an unctuous umami & ale flavoured sauce.Very filling and extremely well seasoned and tasty.Friendly & efficient staff make this place worth seeking out for good quality filling fare."
Already planning my next visit,>,We rocked up to Mildred's for dinner and were surprised by the large queues! We thought that this place must be good and we popped our names down and waited nearly an hour for our table.It was warm when we visited so there was plenty of space to wait outside - I would dread to think of what it'll be like in the colder seasons (very cramped I assume!).We shared 3 starters and one main between us two ladies and left pleasantly satisfied.
Fantastic vegetarian/vegan restaurant,Date of visit: November 2016,"Mildred's is a fantastic place to eat, whether you are vegetarian or not. Very good range of tasty dishes, drinks and cocktails . Comfortable and friendly atmosphere, great service and always a favourite when visiting London/ Soho."
Well worth a visit,Date of visit: November 2016,"We visited this restaurant based on a recommendation and the TripAdvisor reviews. It didn't disappoint.We had to wait for a table; they do not take bookings so it's pot luck. We arrived early for lunch and were told it would be about 25 minutes so we got drinks at the bar, but it took much less to be told the table was ready.The room is fairly small and not elaborate but the ethos of this restaurant is simple......quality food, drink and service......no need to hide it behind fancy decor. There was music in the bar area but we couldn't hear it in the restaurant as there was a real buzz from all the chatter at the tables and by the waiting team.Our waiter was friendly and efficient; as it was our first visit he took time to talk through some of the menu items. All drink served is organic and we had one of the wines which was very nice. I don't know if the food is organic but it was very good quality, tasty and great value for London prices. We'd recommend the halloumi burger and sweet potato fries, the curry and one of the salads! We also had the chocolate and beetroot cake; it was tasty but surprisingly a little dry so as it should be very moist I can only guess it was the end piece.Pudding aside, we really enjoyed the meal at Mildred's and would go again and recommend it."
Still up there with the greats!,Date of visit: November 2016,"Mildred's really is a Soho institution and I've been going there off and on for 15 years or so, although it's been a good few years since my last visit. I was more than pleased to find that it was as good as ever! Yes, you have to queue as you can't book, yes, it's incredibly busy, but the food is fantastic and the service, bearing in mind that it's about as full on as it could be is pretty good. Everything but everything on the menu tempted me, in the past everything has been stop on. I don't know how long Mildred's has been going for but at this rate it will be going on for a good more years."
Worth waiting for.,>,"Amazing vegan and veggie food. Very compact space but comfortable. You cannot book but that does mean you can pop in and after a delicious cocktail at the bar you will be seated, rather than turned away. I took my meat eating boyfriend and he loved it. Try the basil mayo!"
I wasn't disappointed!,Date of visit: November 2016,"I'd heard from a friend how good Mildred's was. I was absolutely delighted. The plethora of excellent vegan food to choose from was staggering, it took me forever to choose! The food I had was amazing. I can't recommend this place enough. The service was excellent too."
Best vegan cake I have eaten,Date of visit: November 2016,"3 of us had mushroom and ale pie, burrito and smoked tofu burger with chips. All were amazing (we all shared) and the desserts- beetroot chocolate fudge cake and vanilla ice cream with warm salted caramel and coffee sauce were some of the nicest we have eaten! It was all served quickly but didn't feel rushed. We will definitely be returning :)"
,,
Best vegetarian burger ever,>,"I wouldn't normally choose vegetarian but was enticed in by the food on the window. Fresh, colourful, varied and different.The Polish burger is amazing. I will definitely be back"
Vegetarian Food at its Best.,Date of visit: November 2016,A busy restaurant which provides a buzzing atmosphere and delicious vegetarian food. It is run efficiently ensuring you don't have a long wait and that the food is served promptly and hot.For a real vegetarian experience I would definitely recommend Mildred's.
Poetry in vegetarian food,Date of visit: October 2016,"It is vegetarian food ,alright.But you cannot pinpoint any particular region.It is a fusion,but,oh,what a fusion.There were soups-we had sweet potato soup,starters,main courses,side dishes& desserts.we ordered a starter(forget the name)with peanut chutney,one main dish with rice( something like a pulav),with Sri Lankan Sambal,&another a veggie burger( boy,was it huge!) with a side dish of toasted broccoli in soya sauce.All very unusual,all very delicious.But way too much.I could not eat even half&I,still feel guilty.portions are large.And it is almost always crowded.Go for it.It cost us 45 £.It was our wedding anniversary &we thoroughly enjoyed the food."
ALWAYS A FAVOURITE,Date of visit: November 2016,".. experimental vegetarian DELICIOUSNESS, often a takeaway treat or dinner with friends. This place is incredibly busy at all times but service is always impeccable. Taste and quality never changes."
A Breath of Fresh Air,Date of visit: October 2016,"Having visited Mildreds in Soho due to a friends recommendation I really liked it.The menu is pretty basic but that's all it needs to be, concentrate on the food that's there and do it really well, which is exactly what Mildreds does. I had the halloumi burger, which was great and the meat wasn't missed at all. I'm not a vegetarian but I have drastically reduced my meat days down both for myself and the planet, the lack of good vegetarian restaurants makes this sometimes hard, there should defiantly be more restaurants like Mildreds. Keep up the good work guys."
Nice even for non vegetarians,Date of visit: October 2016,Went here with one vegetarian in a party of 4 and yet we all found something to order and enjoy on the menu. Very busy place however so plan to wait and have a drink first. Upstairs is fine to dine as well so don't rule it out.
Best meal ever - loved it!,>  >  >  >,We were so excited to come here having heard so many great things about it. We run a pub where we serve predominantly vegan food and crave the opportunity to experience being cooked for. This was everything we could have hoped for. The food was incredible and the staff a delight. Can't wait to come back.
Never changes,Date of visit: October 2016,"Mildreds delivere excellent vegan / vegetarian food and has done every time we have been - good that the standard does not drop.. My wife cant eat onion - which means only a couple of things on the menu were OK. That was a pity but they worked round it so her meal was acceptable, mine excellent. No booking so allow an hours wait. We arrived at 5.15 on a Wednesday and got a table almost straight away and left at 7 so for ptre theatre i would be there at 5. If you arrived at 5.30 you would probably not be seated till past 6.Brilliant cocktails by the way"
So good!,>,"Can't promote this place enough!!popped in for a burger and it was the best vegan burger I've ever had! Staff were lovely, sat me really quickly and very attentive. The place is beautiful and food was quick to come out and so delicious! Had the classic burger, sweet potato fries and a green juice all of which were so good! Will defo be returning with everyone I know!"
Hugely tasty and imaginative food,Date of visit: October 2016,Don't be put off by the crowds of people - it is a major struggle to get in - especially as there is a no reservations policy - you will be rewarded by being found a cosy table on one of their many levels and served the most inventive and delicious food. Hearty and moreish / rather than achingly hip - and all the more pleasing for it. Desserts too were outstanding. The highlight for us was the delectable Sri Lankan curry - a must try.

Veggie Heaven in Soho,Date of visit: October 2016,"I visited with a friend who is a definite veggie...I am a happily part time veggie! We had been to a theater matinee and had early dinner (17.45) before heading back up to the Midlands by train.No trouble getting a table at that time although the restaurant was already full, but by the time we left around 19.00 the place was rammed with a queue for a table!! Mildred's doesn't offer a booking system for small numbers so it is a case of timing I guess...and luck!Its a bit noisy and buzzy with absolutely fantastically tasty and filling food. You are spoiled for choice and the portions (even the 'small plates') are generous...so be warned!Good selection of drinks and wines with friendly and efficient service.We were lucky to get a quieter table immediately opposite the stairs and in a corner.We pushed the boat out and ordered dessert...but in fact we were so delightfully full that it was unnecessary and not as enjoyable as it should have been!If you want a great atmosphere and equally great tasty and creative veggie/vegan food then Mildred's is your place."
Lovely Yummy Vegetarian Restaurant,>  >  >  >,Caught up with a friend for lunch here and we really enjoyed the food!Great selection and friendly staff. The restaurant is quite compact on the inside though and a waitress tripped over my chair which was quite disconcerting.They have a no reservation policy so just get there and wait for a seat.
Amazing veggie food,Date of visit: October 2016,
Will be returning soon,Date of visit: October 2016,"My son is a vegan but I'm not. He chose this place and I entered with a heavy heart and was immediately won over by the array of vibrant plates that were emerging from the kitchen. The place is crammed with queues out of the door at peak times and I'm not surprised - this is excellent value for central London. Wonderfully inventive vegan dishes that show you don't have to compromise on flavour - beetroot burger - who'd have thought? Sweet potato chips to die for and a tasty veggie Sri Lankan curry for Mum. Seemed to me every fussy eating fad is covered veggie, vegan, gluten free etc. I'm so relieved to find somewhere to eat with my son and fingers crossed they expand or open a chain?"
Very good vegan place,Date of visit: October 2016,Very nice and with simple vegan meals this place is amazing. Nice cocktails and good atmosphere. Will go back.
Busiest restaurant in the world,>,"I'd never heard of this place (well theres actually 3 in London!) despite being a veggie foodie but my friend from London had tried for ages but never managed to get a table. The waiting area is diddy but we only had to wait about 20 min (not the 45), before we got a table. The bar staff were really friendly and had good sense of humour. The restaurant is quite tightly packed but actually the hustle and bustle on a wet Monday evening added to the charm. We both had gyoza to start with a tasty sweet dip - delicious. Then mushroom and ale pie, peas and chips which were amazing. Really rich and thick mushrooms and sauce, crisps chips (not really fries as advertised) and nice mushy peas. Pastry was also dedicate. Waited was prompt, friendly and not intrusive. A great evening out and I'll definitely go again!"
Amazing food,Date of visit: October 2016,The food is amazing! We had the Shri Lankan curry and Stir Fried Veggies with Tofu. We also ordered sweet potatoes with basil mayo dressing as a side cause we really wanted to try it. Everything was totally amazing and it worth's the waiting. Service was friendly.If you want to visit on a Saturday keep in mind that it can be really crowded and loud. It took us 1 hour from the time we got there to actually have our order.I will visit again but probably on a weekday this time.
Excellent food,>  >,Lovely restaurant. Menu choice is really varied. Great value and service. Sri Lankan curry was to die for ! Only wish they took bookings. Although definitely worth the wait. Note that you can't get a table until all your guests are at the restaurant.
Worth the wait,Date of visit: October 2016,"I've been to Mildred's several times and have never been disappointed. As you can't book a table there has always been a wait, but it is worth it. I am a vegan and love that there is a good choice. My family are all meat eaters but they are always happy to eat here. (Even my teenage nephew agreed that a meal without meat was ok!)"
"Wonderful food, great service",Date of visit: September 2016,"We were taken here by our daughter who is vegetarian and who had been here several times before. Although my wife and I are not vegetarian, we do enjoy vegetarian dishes as long as they are tasty and well made using fresh ingredients. The dishes here were all absolutely fantastic. We considered ourselves fortunate in being able to get a table as the restaurant was very busy and it is not possible to book a table in advance. Tables often need to be shared but that is not a problem as the atmosphere is bustling and friendly. The wines are reasonably priced and the one we chose was very drinkable. The service was relaxed and friendly, yet very efficient. We shall definitely return when we are next in London."
,,
O M G Wonderful food,Date of visit: October 2016,"Taken here by vegetarian/vegan friends and I was not disappointed. We had to wait about 35 minutes for a table but were able to have a cocktail which went on the table bill. That was a very tasty start then the evening got better and betterBetween five of us we had three tofu burgers, a small plate of something, and I had a halloumi burger. It was delicious, didn't miss meat at all!! Regular chips, blue corn chips & guacamole, and sweet potato chips as sharing sides all good. Then I had rhubarb pavlova with coconut cream. This was good - unusual meringue as it was vegan but delicious. My friend had a raw chocolate tart which she raved about. Will definitely be coming again. We sat upstairs where there was interesting art work on the walls. There was also a smaller room for a private group. Reasonable prices"
Worth the wait,Date of visit: October 2016,Absolutely fabulous food and even better service. Our waitress ola was just a delight.. considering its such a busy restaurant ola never made us feel rushed and helpfully dealt with my boyfriends allergies.Thanks for a fab night x
"Overrated, poor service, ok food",Date of visit: October 2016,"We went for lunch in October and have dined here a couple of times in the past. I doubt we would go back.A few issues with this restaurant, with the hype really not living up to what you end up with.Service is a large part of the problem. At no point during our meal did any wait staff ask if everything was ok. Nor when providing the bill if we had enjoyed our meal. Some of the wait staff look utterly miserable too. The menu itself is pretty lacklustre. For the prices I would much rather dine at the many other vegetarian restaurants in London.We ordered mocktails which were about £5 each and were presented in a really dull way and was basically glorified cucumber water... The food itself was good in quality and portions but again, really there was no sign of creativity in creating interesting vegetarian food. Tables are squashed together so you end up hearing everything from the table next to you. It's extremely loud in the restaurant, so you have to shout to have a conversation. Also, as they don't take bookings people queue in the street, a bit awkward when the weather is bad as there is nowhere indoors to wait.I ordered a side of Asian broccoli with my meal. My main dish was stir fry vegetables with brown rice. The waiter did not bother to point out that my main meal would actually come with loads of broccoli. Another sign the staff are not connecting the dots.I would definitely not queue to eat here again sadly, overall we felt totally underwhelmed. We could easily have made the dishes on the menu at home. Very little seems to have changed on it since the last time we came here about 3 years ago."
Gorgeous vegan grub,Date of visit: October 2016,The title says it all really. Lovely little gaff with a vegan rhubarb pavlova to die for.Well worth a visit.
Well worth the wait,Date of visit: October 2016,I've tried three times to get into Mildreds but was always put off by the enormous queues for dinner. Thankfully I had a free lunchtime to visit today with a friend and we were sat down straight away - outside in the beautiful sunshine. Service was fast and friendly and both of us loved our lunch. The tagine was fresh and full of flavour and I really enjoyed the quinoa it came with. The food is delicious! I'll definitely come back and will have no problem with queuing now I know it's well worth the wait.
"Delicious,  friendly",Date of visit: October 2016,Came here for lunch during a very busy time. Staff was very friendly even though i was waiting for my friend for a while i didn't feel the pressure to vacate. The food was also delicious and reasonably priced. Recommend for a vegan and vegetarian fest.
Great food - but long and awkward wait,Date of visit: September 2016,"We came for dinner before our theater show in Soho. I had the polish burger and my friend the Burrito, with a side of lebneh and courgettes. All food was good, except the side dish was average. My beetroot n grain (polish) burger in particular was lovely and juicy, and very well seasoned, would recommend. The reason im under rating this restaurant is because there was too much of a wait, and there is no room TO wait - its a small place, and i think they can afford to expand at this point. It was quite uncomfortable waiting for a table in a small space. Additionally it was quite inconsistent as people that came 40 minutes after us got a table the same time as us. We almost missed our theater since we waited for 40-45 minutes. The food was worth it thankfully but we had to order drinks n olives (which are delicious) to keep us from fainting while waiting heh. Service was also quite slow and left alot to be desired"
Good lunch,Date of visit: September 2016,This restaurant is in a very lovely street in heart of the Soho. Restaurant it self is also lovely little place with growded people. I was there lunch time and needed to wait some time to get a table. As this place was full of guests the noice was also the same.It was even hard to hear my own thoughs during my solo luch. Well the food was very good!
Always Good,Date of visit: September 2016,"The Halloumi with aubergine, harissa and tahini on flatbread with some sweet potato fries and a lovely Urab salad was perfect to share for lunch."
Do vegans do soft furnishings?,Date of visit: September 2016,
